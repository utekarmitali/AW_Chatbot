{"instruction": "Answer the following AWS FAQ question", "input": "What are the key benefits of using gRPC with Amazon CloudFront?", "output": "Security - gRPC uses HTTP/2, which ensures traffic is end-to-end encrypted from the client to your origin servers. Additionally, when using gRPC, you get AWS Shield Standard at no additional cost and AWS WAF can be configured to helps protect gRPC traffic from attacks.Better performance - gRPC leverages a binary message format, called Protocol Buffers, which are smaller than traditional payloads, like JSON used with RESTful APIs. Parsing Protocol Buffers is less CPU-intensive because data is in a binary format which means that messages are exchanged faster. This results in better overall performance.Built-in streaming support - Streaming is a built-in part of the gRPC framework and supports both client-side and server-side streaming semantics. This makes it much simpler to build streaming services or clients. gRPC on CloudFront supports the following streaming combinations:Unary (no streaming)Client-to-server streamingServer-to-client streamingBi-directional streaming [Source: https://aws.amazon.com/cloudfront/faqs/]"}

When designing your own cache, there are a variety of scenarios where deploying one or more read replicas for a given primary node might make sense. Common reasons for deploying a read replica include:Scaling beyond the compute or I/O capacity of a single primary node for read-heavy workloads: This excess read traffic can be directed to one or more read replicas.Serving read traffic while the primary is unavailable: If your primary node cannot take I/O requests (for example, due to I/O suspension for backups or scheduled maintenance), you can direct read traffic to your read replicas. For this use case, keep in mind that the data on the read replica might be stale, since the primary instance is unavailable. The read replica can also be used warmed up to restart a failed primary.Data protection scenarios: In the unlikely event of primary node failure or that the AZ in which your primary node resides becomes unavailable, you can promote a read replica in a different AZ to become the new primary.

{"instruction": "Answer the following AWS FAQ question", "input": "Why should I use X-Ray?", "output": "Currently, if you build and run distributed applications, you have to rely on a per-service or per-resource process to track requests for your application as it travels across various components that make up your application. This problem is further complicated by the varying log formats and storage mediums across frameworks, services, and resources your application runs on or uses. This makes it difficult to correlate the various pieces of data and create an end-to-end picture of a request from the time it originates at the end-user or service to when a response is returned by your application. X-Ray provides a user-centric model, instead of service-centric or resource-centric model, for collecting data related to requests made to your application. This model enables you to create a user-centric picture of requests as they travel across services and resources. By correlating and aggregating data on your behalf, X-Ray enables you to focus on improving the experience for end-users of your application. [Source: https://aws.amazon.com/xray/faqs/]"}

Enhanced I/O threads improve performance by using more cores for processing I/O and dynamically adjusting to the workload. ElastiCache improves the throughput of TLS-enabled clusters by offloading encryption to the same enhanced I/O threads. ElastiCache (Redis OSS) version 7.0 introduced enhanced I/O multiplexing, that combines many client requests into a single channel and improves thread efficiency.InElastiCache version 7.1 (https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/database/achieve-over-500-million-requests-per-second-per-cluster-with-amazon-elasticache-for-redis-7-1/)and aboveforRedis OSS(https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/database/achieve-over-500-million-requests-per-second-per-cluster-with-amazon-elasticache-for-redis-7-1/), we extended the enhanced I/O threads functionality to also handle the presentation layer logic. Enhanced I/O threads not only read client input, but also parses the input into a binary command format, which is then forwarded to the main thread for execution, to provide performance gains. With ElastiCache version 7.1 for Redis OSS, you can achieve up to 100% more throughput and 50% lower P99 latency, compared to prior version.

Conversely, many organizations would like to make their data available for research or commercial purposes, but its too hard and expensive to build and maintain data delivery, entitlement, and billing technology, which further depresses the supply of valuable data.</p> [Source: https://aws.amazon.com/redshift/faqs/]"}

{"instruction": "Answer the following AWS FAQ question", "input": "What is server-side encryption?", "output": "Server-side encryption for Kinesis Data Streams automatically encrypts data using a user specified AWS KMS key before it is written to the data stream storage layer, and decrypts the data after it is retrieved from storage. Encryption makes writes impossible and the payload and the partition key unreadable unless the user writing or reading from the data stream has the permission to use the key selected for encryption on the data stream. As a result, server-side encryption can make it easier to meet internal security and compliance requirements governing your data.With server-side encryption your client-side applications (producers and consumers) do not need to be aware of encryption, they do not need to manage KMS keys or cryptographic operations, and your data is encrypted when it is at rest and in motion within the Kinesis Data Streams service. All KMS keys used by the server-side encryption feature are provided by the AWS KMS. AWS KMS makes it easy to use an AWS-managedKMS key for Kinesis (a one-click encryption method), your own AWS KMS customer-managed key, or aKMS key that you imported for encryption.

{"instruction": "Answer the following AWS FAQ question", "input": "What is the syntax of Metric Filter patterns?", "output": "A Metric Filter pattern can contain search terms or a specification of your common log or JSON event format.For example, if you want to search for the term Error, the pattern for the metric filter would just be the term Error. Multiple search terms can be included to search for multiple terms. For example, if you wanted to count events which contained the terms Error and Exception you would use the pattern Error Exception. If you wanted to match the term Error Exception exactly, you would put double quotes around the search term, \"Error Exception\". You can specify as many search terms as you like.CloudWatch Logs can also be used to extract values from a log event in common log or JSON format. For example, you could track the bytes transferred from your Apache access logs. You can also use conditional operators and wildcards to match and extract the data you are interested in. To use the extraction feature of Metric Filters, log events must be space delimited and use a starting and ending double quote \"\"\", or, a starting square brace \"[\" and a closing square brace \"]\"square, to enclose fields. Alternatively, they can be JSON-formatted log events. For the full details of the syntax and examples, please see theDeveloper Guide for Metric Filters (https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonCloudWatch/latest/DeveloperGuide/WhatIsCloudWatchLogs.html).

{"instruction": "Answer the following AWS FAQ question", "input": "Why should I use a Redshift Multi-AZ deployment?", "output": "<p>Unlike single-AZ deployments, customers can now improve availability of Redshift by running their data warehouse in a multi-AZ deployment. A multi-AZ deployment allows you to run your data warehouse in multiple AWS Availability Zones (AZ) simultaneously and continue operating in unforeseen failure scenarios. No application changes are required to maintain business continuity since the Multi-AZ deployment is managed as a single data warehouse with one endpoint. Multi-AZ deployments reduce recovery time by guaranteeing capacity to automatically recover and are intended for customers with business-critical analytics applications that require the highest levels of availability and resiliency to AZ failures. This also allows customers to implement a solution that is more compliant with the recommendations of the Reliability Pillar of the AWS Well-Architected Framework.

{"instruction": "Answer the following AWS FAQ question", "input": "How do applications use a signaling channel to enable peer-to-peer connectivity?", "output": "Streaming applications can maintain persistent connectivity with a signaling channel and wait for other applications to connect to them or they can connect to a signaling channel only when they need to live stream media. The signaling channel enables applications to connect with each other in a one to few model using the concept of one master connecting to multiple viewers. The application that initiates the connection assumes the responsibility of a master via the ConnectAsMaster API and wait for viewers. Upto 10 applications can then connect to that signaling channel by assuming the viewer responsibility via the ConnectAsViewer API. Once connected to the signaling channel, the master and viewer applications can send each other signaling messages to establish peer-t0-peer connectivity for live media streaming.

{"instruction": "Answer the following AWS FAQ question", "input": "How long will Amazon CloudFront keep my files at the edge locations?", "output": "By default, if no cache control header is set, each edge location checks for an updated version of your file whenever it receives a request more than 24 hours after the previous time it checked the origin for changes to that file. This is called the expiration period. You can set this expiration period as short as 0 seconds, or as long as youd like, by setting the cache control headers on your files in your origin. Amazon CloudFront uses these cache control headers to determine how frequently it needs to check the origin for an updated version of that file. For expiration period set to 0 seconds, Amazon CloudFront will revalidate every request with the origin server. If your files dont change very often, it is best practice to set a long expiration period and implement a versioning system to manage updates to your files.

{"instruction": "Answer the following AWS FAQ question", "input": "How do applications live stream peer-to-peer media when they are located behind a NAT or a firewall?", "output": "Applications use Kinesis Video Streams STUN end point to discover their public IP address when they are located behind a NAT or a firewall. An application provides its public IP address as a possible location where it can receive connection requests from other applications for live streaming. The default option for all WebRTC communication is direct peer-to-peer connectivity but if the NAT or firewall does now allow direct connectivity (e.g. in case of symmetric NATs), applications can connect to the Kinesis Video Streams TURN end points for relaying media via the cloud. The GetIceServerConfig API provides the necessary TURN end point information that applications can use in their WebRTC configuration. This configuration allows applications to use TURN relay as a fallback when they are unable to establish a direct peer-to-peer connection for live streaming.

{"instruction": "Answer the following AWS FAQ question", "input": "How do I select an appropriate node type for my application?", "output": "Though there is no precise answer for this question, with ElastiCache, you don't need to worry about getting the number of nodes exactly right, as you can quickly add or remove nodes later. You can also use ElastiCache Serverless to simplify running a highly available Memcached cache. The following two inter-related aspects can be considered for the choice of your initial configuration:The total memory required for your data to achieve your target cache-hit rate, andThe number of nodes required to maintain acceptable application performance without overloading the database backend in the event of node failures.The amount of memory required is dependent upon the size of your data set and the access patterns of your application. To improve fault tolerance, once you have a rough idea of the total memory required, divide that memory into enough nodes such that your application can survive the loss of one or two nodes. For example, if your memory requirement is 13 GB, you might want to use two cache.m4.large nodes instead of using one cache.m4.xlarge node. It is important that other systems such as databases will not be overloaded if the cache-hit rate is temporarily reduced during failure recovery of one or more nodes.

{"instruction": "Answer the following AWS FAQ question", "input": "How does Amazon SWF help with scaling my applications?", "output": "Amazon SWF lets you scale your applications by giving you full control over the number of workers that you run for each activity type and the number of instances that you run for a decider. By increasing the number of workers or decider instances, you increase the compute resources allocated for the corresponding processing steps and, thereby, the throughput for those steps. To auto-scale, you can use run-time data that Amazon SWF provides through its APIs. For example, Amazon SWF provides the number of tasks in a task list. Since an increase in this number implies that the workers are not keeping up with the load, you can spin up new workers automatically whenever the backlog of tasks crosses a threshold.

{"instruction": "Answer the following AWS FAQ question", "input": "How does Amazon Aurora Optimized Reads for Aurora PostgreSQL impact query latency in the event of a database failover?", "output": "In the event of a database failover, the query latency will temporarily increase after failover. This latency increase will reduce over time and eventually catch up to the query latency prior to failover. This catch-up duration can be expedited by enablingcluster cache management (CCM) (https://docs.aws.amazon.com/prescriptive-guidance/latest/ccm-and-qpm-aurora-postgresql/cluster-cache-management.html). With CCM, customers can designate a specific Aurora PostgreSQL database instance as the failover target.When CCM is enabled, the local storage cache of the designated failover target closely mirrors the local storage cache of the primary instance, reducing the catch-up time post failover. However, enabling CCM could impact the long-term efficacy of the local storage cache if the designated failover target is also being used to serve a read workload separate from the workload on the writer instance.Therefore, customers running workloads that require a reader to be designated as the stand-by failover must enable CCM to increase their likelihood of quickly regaining their query latency post failover. Customers running separate workloads on their designated failover targets may want to balance their needs for immediate latency recovery post failover with long term effectiveness of the cache performance, prior to enabling CCM.

{"instruction": "Answer the following AWS FAQ question", "input": "How does a decider coordinate a workflow in Amazon SWF?", "output": "The decider can be viewed as a special type of worker. Like workers, it can be written in any language and asks Amazon SWF for tasks. However, it handles special tasks called decision tasks. Amazon SWF issues decision tasks whenever a workflow execution has transitions such as an activity task completing or timing out. A decision task contains information on the inputs, outputs, and current state of previously initiated activity tasks. Your decider uses this data to decide the next steps, including any new activity tasks, and returns those to Amazon SWF. Amazon SWF in turn enacts these decisions, initiating new activity tasks where appropriate and monitoring them. By responding to decision tasks in an ongoing manner, the decider controls the order, timing, and concurrency of activity tasks and consequently the execution of processing steps in the application. SWF issues the first decision task when an execution starts. From there on, Amazon SWF enacts the decisions made by your decider to drive your execution. The execution continues until your decider makes a decision to complete it.To help the decider in making decisions, SWF maintains an ongoing record on the details of all tasks in an execution. This record is called the history and is unique to each execution. A new history is initiated when an execution begins. At that time, the history contains initial information such as the executions input data. Later, as workers process activity tasks, Amazon SWF updates the history with their input and output data, and their latest state. When a decider gets a decision task, it can inspect the executions history. Amazon SWF ensures that the history accurately reflects the execution state at the time the decision task is issued. Thus, the decider can use the history to determine what has occurred in the execution and decide the appropriate next steps. [Source: https://aws.amazon.com/swf/faqs/]"}

{"instruction": "Answer the following AWS FAQ question", "input": "How do I run applications and services on Amazon ECS?", "output": "Yes. The Amazon ECS service scheduler can manage long-running applications and services. The service scheduler helps you maintain application availability and allows you to scale your containers up or down to meet your application's capacity requirements. The service scheduler allows you to distribute traffic across your containers using ELB. Amazon ECS will automatically register and deregister your containers from the associated load balancer. The service scheduler will also automatically recover containers that become unhealthy (i.e., fail ELB health checks) or stop running to ensure you have the desired number of healthy containers supporting your application.\nYou can scale your application up and down by changing the number of containers you want the service to run. You can update your application by changing its definition or using a new image. The scheduler will automatically start new containers using the new definition and stop containers running the previous version (waiting for the ELB connections to drain if ELB is used).
