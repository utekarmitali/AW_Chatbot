            "✅ Reference: In the event of a database failover, the query latency will temporarily increase after failover. This latency increase will reduce over time and eventually catch up to the query latency prior to failover. This catch-up duration can be expedited by enablingcluster cache management (CCM) (https://docs.aws.amazon.com/prescriptive-guidance/latest/ccm-and-qpm-aurora-postgresql/cluster-cache-management.html). With CCM, customers can designate a specific Aurora PostgreSQL database instance as the failover target.When CCM is enabled, the local storage cache of the designated failover target closely mirrors the local storage cache of the primary instance, reducing the catch-up time post failover. However, enabling CCM could impact the long-term efficacy of the local storage cache if the designated failover target is also being used to serve a read workload separate from the workload on the writer instance.Therefore, customers running workloads that require a reader to be designated as the stand-by failover must enable CCM to increase their likelihood of quickly regaining their query latency post failover. Customers running separate workloads on their designated failover targets may want to balance their needs for immediate latency recovery post failover with long term effectiveness of the cache performance, prior to enabling CCM.\n",

It enables you to store and retrieve Amazon S3 objects through standard file storage protocols. File Gateway allows your existing file-based applications or devices to use secure and durable cloud storage without needing to be modified. With S3 File Gateway, your configured S3 buckets will be available as Network File System (NFS) mount points or Server Message Block (SMB) file shares. Your applications read and write files and directories over NFS or SMB, interfacing to the gateway as a file server. In turn, the gateway translates these file operations into object requests on your S3 buckets. Your most recently used data is cached on the gateway for low-latency access, and data transfer between your data center and AWS is fully managed and optimized by the gateway. Once in S3, you can access the objects directly or manage them using S3 features such as S3 Lifecycle Policies and S3 Cross-Region Replication (CRR). You can run S3 File Gateway on-premises or in EC2.\n",

            "**Explanation:** The explanation\n",
            "✅ Reference: In Amazon SWF, an application is implemented by building workers and a decider which communicate directly with the service. Workers are programs that interact with Amazon SWF to get tasks, process received tasks, and return the results. The decider is a program that controls the coordination of tasks, i.e. their ordering, concurrency, and scheduling according to the application logic. The workers and the decider can run on cloud infrastructure, such as Amazon EC2, or on machines behind firewalls. Amazon SWF brokers the interactions between workers and the decider. It allows the decider to get consistent views into the progress of tasks and to initiate new tasks in an ongoing manner. At the same time, Amazon SWF stores tasks, assigns them to workers when they are ready, and monitors their progress. It ensures that a task is assigned only once and is never duplicated. Since Amazon SWF maintains the applications state durably, workers and deciders dont have to keep track of execution state. They can run independently, and scale quickly. Please see Functionality section of the Amazon SWF detail page to learn more about the steps in building applications with Amazon SWF.You can have several concurrent runs of a workflow on Amazon SWF. Each run is referred to as a workflow execution or an execution. Executions are identified with unique names. You use the Amazon SWF Management Console (or the visibility APIs) to view your executions as a whole and to drill down on a given execution to see task-level details.\n",

            "✅ Reference: Currently, if you build and run distributed applications, you have to rely on a per-service or per-resource process to track requests for your application as it travels across various components that make up your application. This problem is further complicated by the varying log formats and storage mediums across frameworks, services, and resources your application runs on or uses. This makes it difficult to correlate the various pieces of data and create an end-to-end picture of a request from the time it originates at the end-user or service to when a response is returned by your application. X-Ray provides a user-centric model, instead of service-centric or resource-centric model, for collecting data related to requests made to your application. This model enables you to create a user-centric picture of requests as they travel across services and resources. By correlating and aggregating data on your behalf, X-Ray enables you to focus on improving the experience for end-users of your application.\n",
