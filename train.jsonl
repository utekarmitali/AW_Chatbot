It simplifies incident logging by helping remove operational dependencies and provides tools that can help reduce your reliance on complex data process pipelines that span across teams. CloudTrail Lake does not require you to move and ingest CloudTrail logs elsewhere, which helps maintain data fidelity and decreases dealing with low-rate limits that throttle your logs. It also provides near real-time latencies as it is fine-tuned to process high-volume structured logs, making them available for incident investigation. It provides a familiar, multi-attribute query experience using SQL, with the ability to schedule and handle multiple concurrent queries. For users less experienced with SQL, natural language query generation is available to help create SQL queries, simplifying data analysis. The ability to summarize query results using AI (in preview) further enhances your capacity to derive meaningful insights from your activity logs and efficiently investigate incidents.Additionally, pre-curated and custom dashboards offer intuitive ways to visualize and analyze your data stored in event data stores directly within the CloudTrail console. By combining these features, CloudTrail Lake empowers you to efficiently investigate incidents and gain deeper insights into your AWS environment, all while simplifying your data management processes.

{"instruction": "Answer the following AWS FAQ question", "input": "What are the benefits of Amazon SWF vs. homegrown solutions and existing workflow products?", "output": "When building solutions to coordinate tasks in a distributed environment, developers have to account for several variables. Tasks that drive processing steps can be long-running and may fail, timeout, or require restarts. They often complete with varying throughputs and latencies. Tracking and visualizing tasks in all these cases is not only challenging, but is also undifferentiated work. As applications and tasks scale up, developers face difficult distributed systems problems. For example, they must ensure that a task is assigned only once and that its outcome is tracked reliably through unexpected failures and outages. By using Amazon SWF, developers can focus on their differentiated application logic, i.e. how to process tasks and how to coordinate them.Existing workflow products often force developers to learn specialized languages, host expensive databases, and give up control over task execution. The specialized languages make it difficult to express complex applications and are not flexible enough for effecting changes quickly. Amazon SWF, on the other hand, is a cloud-based service, allows common programming languages to be used, and lets developers control where tasks are processed. By adopting a loosely coupled model for distributed applications, Amazon SWF enables changes to be made in an agile manner. [Source: https://aws.amazon.com/swf/faqs/]"}

{"instruction": "Answer the following AWS FAQ question", "input": "How do workers and deciders communicate with Amazon SWF? Isnt a poll protocol resource-intensive?", "output": "Typically poll based protocols require developers to find an optimal polling frequency. If developers poll too often, it is possible that many of the polls will be returned with empty results. This leads to a situation where much of the application and network resources are spent on polling without any meaningful outcome to drive the execution forward. If developers dont poll often enough, then messages may be held for longer increasing application latencies.To overcome the inefficiencies inherent in polling, Amazon SWF provides long-polling. Long-polling significantly reduces the number of polls that return without any tasks. When workers and deciders poll Amazon SWF for tasks, the connection is retained for a minute if no task is available. If a task does become available during that period, it is returned in response to the long-poll request. By retaining the connection for a period of time, additional polls that would also return empty during that period are avoided. With long-polling, your applications benefit with the security and flow control advantages of polling without sacrificing the latency and efficiency benefits offered by push-based web services.

However, there are limits on the number of volumes that can be created with immediate full performance. These limits are expressed in the form of a credit bucket that is associated with an FSR-enabled snapshot in a given AZ. The important things to know regarding credits:\n1. A single volume create operation consumes a single credit 2. The number of credits is a function of the FSR-enabled snapshot size 3. Credits refill over time 4. Maximum credit bucket size is 10\nTo estimate your credit bucket size and fill rate, divide 1,024 by your snapshot size. For example, a 100 GiB FSR-enabled snapshot will have the maximum balance of 10 credits with a fill rate of 10 credits every hour. A 4 TiB snapshot will have a maximum balance of 1 with a fill rate of 1 credit every 4 hours.\nIt's important to note that the credit bucket size is a function of the FSR-enabled snapshot size, not the size of the volumes that are created. For example, it is possible to create up to ten 1TiB volumes from a 100GiB snapshot at once.\nLastly, each AZ in which the snapshot is FSR-enabled gets its own credit bucket independent of other AZs.

{"instruction": "Answer the following AWS FAQ question", "input": "How do table buckets work?", "output": "S3 Tables provide purpose-built S3 storage for storing structured data in the Apache Parquet format. Within a table bucket, you can create tables as first-class resources directly in S3. These tables can be secured with table-level permissions defined in either identity- or resource-based policies, and are accessible by applications or tooling that supports the Apache Iceberg standard. When you create a table in your table bucket, the underlying data in S3 is stored as Parquet files. Then, S3 uses the Apache Iceberg standard to store the metadata necessary to make that Parquet data queryable by your applications. S3 Tables include a client library that is used by query engines to navigate and update the Iceberg metadata of tables in your table bucket. This library, in conjunction with updated S3 APIs for table operations, allows multiple clients to safely read and write data to your tables. Over time, S3 automatically optimizes the underlying Parquet data by rewriting, or \"compacting\u201d your objects. Compaction optimizes your data on S3 to improve query performance.

{"instruction": "Answer the following AWS FAQ question", "input": "How do dead-letter queues work?", "output": "When you create your source queue, Amazon SQS allows you to specify a dead-letter queue (DLQ) and the condition under which SQS should move messages to the DLQ. The condition is the number of times a consumer can receive a message from the queue, defined as maxReceiveCount. This configuration of a dead-letter queue with a source queue and the maxReceiveCount is known as the redrive policy. When the ReceiveCount for a message exceeds the maxReceiveCount for a queue, Amazon SQS is designed to move the message to a dead-letter queue (with its original message ID). For example, if the source queue has a redrive policy with maxReceiveCount set to five, and the consumer of the source queue receives a message six times without successfully consuming it, SQS moves the message to the dead-letter queue.The redrive policy manages the first half of the life cycle of unconsumed messages by moving them from a source queue to a dead-letter queue. Now the dead-letter queue redrive to source queue efficiently completes the cycle by moving those messages back to their source queue, as shown below. [Source: https://aws.amazon.com/sqs/faqs/]"}

{"instruction": "Answer the following AWS FAQ question", "input": "How does Kinesis Data Streams pricing work in provisioned mode?", "output": "With provisioned capacity mode, you specify the number of shards necessary for your application based on its write and read request rate. A shard is a unit of capacity that provides 1 MB/second of write and 2 MB/second of read throughout. Youre charged for each shard at an hourly rate. You also pay for records written into your Kinesis data stream. You incur additional charges when you use optional features such as Extended retention and Enhanced Fan-Out.Following are two core dimensions and three optional dimensions in Kinesis Data Streams provisioned mode:Hourly Shard cost determined by the number of shards within your Amazon Kinesis data stream.PUT Payload Unit cost determined by the number of 25 KB payload units that your data producers add to your data stream.Optional:Extended data retention is an optional cost determined by the number of shard hours incurred by your data stream. When extended data retention is enabled, you pay the extended retention rate for each shard in your stream.Long-term data retention is an optional cost with two cost dimensions: long-term data storage and long-term data retrieval. Long-term data storage reflects the numbers of GB-months data is stored for the period greater than seven days and up to 365 days. Long-term data retrieval reflects the number of GBs of data retrieved that has been stored for more than seven days.Enhanced fan-out is an optional cost with two cost dimensions: consumer-shard hours and data retrievals. Consumer-shard hours reflect the number of shards in a stream multiplied by the number of consumers using enhanced fan-out. Data retrievals are determined by the number of GBs delivered to consumers using enhanced fan-out.For more information about Kinesis Data Streams costs, seeAmazon Kinesis Data Streams Pricing (https://aws.amazon.com/kinesis/data-streams/pricing/).

{"instruction": "Answer the following AWS FAQ question", "input": "When should I use Amazon EC2 Auto Scaling vs. AWS Auto Scaling?", "output": "You should use AWS Auto Scaling to manage scaling for multiple resources across multiple services. AWS Auto Scaling lets you define dynamic scaling policies for multiple EC2 Auto Scaling groups or other resources using predefined scaling strategies. Using AWS Auto Scaling to configure scaling policies for all of the scalable resources in your application is faster than managing scaling policies for each resource via its individual service console. It\u2019s also easier, as AWS Auto Scaling includes predefined scaling strategies that simplify the setup of scaling policies.\u00a0\nYou should use EC2 Auto Scaling if you only need to scale Amazon EC2 Auto Scaling groups, or if you are only interested in maintaining the health of your EC2 fleet. You should also use EC2 Auto Scaling if you need to create or configure Amazon EC2 Auto Scaling groups, or if you need to set up scheduled or step scaling policies (as AWS Auto Scaling supports only target tracking scaling policies).\nEC2 Auto Scaling groups must be created and configured outside of AWS Auto Scaling, such as through the EC2 console, Auto Scaling API or via CloudFormation.

As a result, you can switch to using ElastiCache without recompiling or relinking your applications: The libraries you use will continue to work. To configure the cache servers your application accesses, update your application's Memcached config file to include the endpoints of the servers (nodes) we provision for you. You can use the Copy Node Endpoints option in the console or the DescribeCacheClusters API to get a list of the endpoints.

In this case, when the current iteration of the query launches, the Kinesis connector would find that no new records are arriving. The connector will keep polling the stream for 2 minutes and if no records arrive for that interval then it will stop and process only those records that were already read in the current batch of stream. However, if new records start arriving before kinesis.nodata.timeout interval is up, then the connector will wait for an additional interval corresponding to a parameter called kinesis.iteration.timeout.

When you run custom code in a shared, multi-tenant compute environment, maintaining a highly secure execution environment is key. A bad actor may attempt exploit bugs present in the runtime, libraries, or CPU to leak sensitive data from the server or from another customers functions. Without a rigorous isolation barrier between function code, these exploits are possible. Both AWS Lambda and Lambda@Edge already achieve this security isolation through theFirecracker based VM isolation (https://aws.amazon.com/about-aws/whats-new/2018/11/firecracker-lightweight-virtualization-for-serverless-computing). With CloudFront Functions, we have developed a process-based isolation model that provides the same security bar against side-channel attacks like Spectre and Meltdown, timing-based attacks or other code vulnerabilities. CloudFront Functions cannot access or modify data belonging to other customers. We do this by running functions in a dedicated process on a dedicated CPU. CloudFront Functions executes on process workers that only serve one customer at a time and all customer-specific data is cleared (flushed) between executions.CloudFront Functions does not use V8 as a JavaScript engine. Functions security model is different, and considered more secure than the v8 isolates based model offered by some other vendors. [Source: https://aws.amazon.com/cloudfront/faqs/]"}

The process also uses public-key cryptography to sign these images with proof of origin that can be validated on the device. Using the integrated FreeRTOS OTA update device job within theAWS IoT Device Management console (https://console.aws.amazon.com/iotdm), developers can upload a new firmware image, sign that image, and deliver it to a group of devices in the field. Those devices will validate the signature upon download and only install trusted code.

{"instruction": "Answer the following AWS FAQ question", "input": "What are workers and deciders?", "output": "In Amazon SWF, an application is implemented by building workers and a decider which communicate directly with the service. Workers are programs that interact with Amazon SWF to get tasks, process received tasks, and return the results. The decider is a program that controls the coordination of tasks, i.e. their ordering, concurrency, and scheduling according to the application logic. The workers and the decider can run on cloud infrastructure, such as Amazon EC2, or on machines behind firewalls. Amazon SWF brokers the interactions between workers and the decider. It allows the decider to get consistent views into the progress of tasks and to initiate new tasks in an ongoing manner. At the same time, Amazon SWF stores tasks, assigns them to workers when they are ready, and monitors their progress. It ensures that a task is assigned only once and is never duplicated. Since Amazon SWF maintains the applications state durably, workers and deciders dont have to keep track of execution state. They can run independently, and scale quickly. Please see Functionality section of the Amazon SWF detail page to learn more about the steps in building applications with Amazon SWF.You can have several concurrent runs of a workflow on Amazon SWF. Each run is referred to as a workflow execution or an execution. Executions are identified with unique names.

It was developed as part of Apache Software Foundation's Hadoop project and runs on top of Hadoop Distributed File System(HDFS) to provide BigTable-like capabilities for Hadoop. HBase provides you a fault-tolerant, efficient way of storing large quantities of sparse data using column-based compression and storage. In addition, HBase provides fast lookup of data because data is stored in-memory instead of on disk. HBase is optimized for sequential write operations, and it is highly efficient for batch inserts, updates, and deletes. HBase works seamlessly with Hadoop, sharing its file system and serving as a direct input and output to Hadoop jobs. HBase also integrates with Apache Hive, enabling SQL-like queries over HBase tables, joins with Hive-based tables, and support for Java Database Connectivity (JDBC).

{"instruction": "Answer the following AWS FAQ question", "input": "What happens during a failover in a Multi-AZ file system and how long does a failover take?", "output": "A:Amazon FSx detects and automatically recovers from failures so that you can resume file system operations as quickly as possible without administrative intervention. When failing over from one file server to another, the new active file server will automatically begin serving all file system reads and write requests. Failovers, as defined by the interval between the detection of the failure on the active and promotion of the other file server to active, typically complete within 30 seconds. Failback will occur once the file server in the preferred subnet is fully recovered (typically under 20 minutes), and also completes within 30 seconds.Windows clients accessing Multi-AZ file systems automatically fail over and fail back with the file system, meaning that users or applications running on Windows clients automatically benefit from the enhanced availability of Multi-AZ file systems. Linux clients dont automatically connect to the standby file server upon a failover, and will automatically resume file system operations once failback to the preferred file server is complete.

{"instruction": "Answer the following AWS FAQ question", "input": "How is Impala different than traditional RDBMSs?", "output": "Traditional relational database systems provide transaction semantics and database atomicity, consistency, isolation, and durability (ACID) properties. They also allow tables to be indexed and cached so that small amounts of data can be retrieved very quickly, provide for fast updates of small amounts of data, and for enforcement of referential integrity constraints. Typically, they run on a single large machine and do not provide support for acting over complex user defined data types. Impala uses a similar distributed query system to that found in RDBMSs, but queries data stored in HDFS and uses the Hive metastore to hold information about the input data. As with Hive, the schema for a query is provided at runtime, allowing for easier schema changes. Also, Impala can query a variety of complex data types and execute user defined functions. However, because Impala processes data in-memory, it is important to understand the hardware limitations of your cluster and optimize your queries for the best performance.

{"instruction": "Answer the following AWS FAQ question", "input": "What is attribute-based access control (ABAC)?", "output": "ABAC is an authorization strategy that defines permissions based on attributes. In AWS, these attributes are calledtags (https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/id_tags.html), and you can define them on AWS resources, IAM roles, and in role sessions. With ABAC, you define a set of permissions based on the value of a tag. You can grant fine-grained permissions to specific resources by requiring the tags on the role or session to match the tags on the resource. For example, you can author a policy that grants developers access to resources tagged with the job title developers. ABAC is helpful in environments that are growing rapidly by granting permissions to resources as they are created with specific tags.

You do not have to use databases, custom systems, or ad hoc solutions to keep execution state.Communicating and managing the flow of work between your application components. With Amazon SWF, you do not need to design a messaging protocol or worry about lost and duplicated tasks.Centralizing the coordination of steps in your application. Your coordination logic does not have to be scattered across different components, but can be encapsulated in a single program.Integrating a range of programs and components, including legacy systems and 3rd party cloud services, into your applications. By allowing your application flexibility in where and in what combination the application components are deployed, Amazon SWF helps you gradually migrate application components from private data centers to public cloud infrastructure without disrupting the application availability or performance.Automating workflows that include long-running human tasks (e.g. approvals, reviews, investigations, etc.) Amazon SWF reliably tracks the status of processing steps that run up to several days or months.Building an application layer on top of Amazon SWF to support domain specific languages for your end users. Since Amazon SWF gives you full flexibility in choosing your programming language, you can conveniently build interpreters for specialized languages (e.g. XPDL) and customized user-interfaces including modeling tools.Getting detailed audit trails and visibility into all running instances of your applications. You can also incorporate visibility capabilities provided by Amazon SWF into your own user interfaces using the APIs provided by Amazon SWF.Customers have used Amazon SWF to build applications for video encoding, social commerce, infrastructure provisioning, MapReduce pipelines, business process management, and several other use cases.

The protocols used for streaming include those that use HTTP for delivery such as Apples HTTP Live Streaming (HLS), MPEG Dynamic Adaptive Streaming over HTTP (MPEG-DASH), Adobes HTTP Dynamic Streaming (HDS) and Microsofts Smooth Streaming. These protocols are different than the delivery of web pages and other online content because streaming protocols deliver media in real time  viewers watch the bytes as they are delivered. Streaming content has several potential benefits for you and your end-users:Streaming can give viewers more control over their viewing experience. For instance, it is easier for a viewer to seek forward and backward in a video using streaming than using traditional download delivery.Streaming can give you more control over your content, as no file remains on the viewer's client or local drive when they finish watching a video.Streaming can help reduce your costs, as it only delivers the portions of a media file that viewers actually watch. In contrast, with traditional downloads, frequently the whole media file will be delivered to viewers, even if they only watch a portion of the file.

{"instruction": "Answer the following AWS FAQ question", "input": "What are the benefits of designing my application as a coordination of tasks? How does Amazon SWF help me with this?", "output": "In Amazon SWF, tasks represent invocations of logical steps in applications. Tasks are processed by workers which are programs that interact with Amazon SWF to get tasks, process them, and return their results. A worker implements an application processing step. You can build workers in different programming languages and even reuse existing components to quickly create the worker. For example, you can use cloud services, enterprise applications, legacy systems, and even simple scripts to implement workers. By independently controlling the number of workers for processing each type of task, you can control the throughput of your application efficiently.To coordinate the application execution across workers, you write a program called the decider in your choice of programming language. The separation of processing steps and their coordination makes it possible to manage your application in a controlled manner and give you the flexibility to deploy, run, scale and update them independently. You can choose to deploy workers and deciders either inthe cloud (https://aws.amazon.com/what-is-cloud-computing/)(e.g. Amazon EC2 or Lambda) or on machines behind corporate firewalls. Because of the decoupling of workers and deciders, your business logic can be dynamic and you application can be quickly updated to accommodate new requirements. For example, you can remove, skip, or retry tasks and create new application flows simply by changing the decider.By implementing workers and deciders, you focus on your differentiated application logic as it pertains to performing the actual processing steps and coordinating them. Amazon SWF handles the underlying details such as storing tasks until they can be assigned, monitoring assigned tasks, and providing consistent information on their completion. Amazon SWF also provides ongoing visibility at the level of each task through APIs and a console. [Source: https://aws.amazon.com/swf/faqs/]"}

You can use the CloudFront usage reports or the CloudFront metrics to help you calculate your requests per second.Determine the typical size of a single real-time log record. A typical record that includes all available fields is around 1 KB. If youre not sure what your log record size is, you can enable real-time logs with a low sampling rate (for example, 1%), and then calculate the average record size using monitoring data in Kinesis Data Streams (total number of records divided by total incoming bytes).Multiply the number of requests per second (from step 1) by the size of a typical real-time log record (from step 2) to determine the amount of data per second that your real-time log configuration is likely to send to the Kinesis data stream.Using the data per second, calculate the number of shards that you need. A single shard can handle no more than 1 MB per second and 1,000 requests (log records) per second. When calculating the number of shards that you need, we recommend adding up to 25% as a buffer.For example, assume your distribution receives 10,000 requests per second, and that your real-time log records size is typically 1 KB. This means that your real-time log configuration could generate 10,000,000 bytes (10,000 multiplied by 1,000), or 9.53 MB, per second. In this scenario you would need just 10 Kinesis shards.

In each rule you can specify a prefix, a time period, a transition to S3 Standard-IA, S3 One Zone-IA, S3 Glacier Instant Retrieval, S3 Glacier Flexible Retrieval, S3 Glacier Deep Archive, and/or an expiration. For example, you could create a rule that archives into S3 Glacier Flexible Retrieval all objects with the common prefix \u201clogs/\u201d 30 days from creation and expires these objects after 365 days from creation.You can also create a separate rule that only expires all objects with the prefix \u201cbackups/\u201d 90 days from creation. S3 Lifecycle policies apply to both existing and new S3 objects, helping you optimize storage and maximize cost savings for all current data and any new data placed in S3 without time-consuming manual data review and migration.Within a lifecycle rule, the prefix field identifies the objects subject to the rule. To apply the rule to an individual object, specify the key name. To apply the rule to a set of objects, specify their common prefix (e.g. \u201clogs/\u201d).

{"instruction": "Answer the following AWS FAQ question", "input": "How do S3 Multi-Region Access Points failover controls work?", "output": "By default, S3 Multi-Region Access Points route requests to the underlying bucket closest to the client, based on network latency in an active-active configuration. For example, you can configure a Multi-Region Access Point with underlying buckets in US East (N. Virginia) and in Asia Pacific (Mumbai). With this configuration, your clients in North America route to US East (N. Virginia), while your clients in Asia route to Asia Pacific (Mumbai). This lowers latency for your requests made to S3, improving the performance of your application. If you prefer an active-passive configuration, all S3 data request traffic can be routed through the S3 Multi-Region Access Point to US East (N. Virginia) as the active Region and no traffic will be routed to Asia Pacific (Mumbai). If there is a planned or unplanned need to failover all of the S3 data request traffic to Asia Pacific (Mumbai), you can initiate a failover to switch to Asia Pacific (Mumbai) as the new active Region within minutes. Any existing uploads or downloads in progress in US East (N.

For example, a table storing user information might be split using the User-ID column as the shard key. Under the hood, Aurora PostgreSQL Limitless Database is a distributed deployment of serverless nodes. Nodes are either routers or shards. Routers manage the distributed nature of the database. Each shard stores a subset of your data, enabling parallel processing to achieve high write throughput.As compute or storage requirements increase, Aurora first automatically scales up each instance and its associated storage and then scales out to serve the database workload for different shard key values. At any point, a shard key value is owned and served by a single serverless instance. When applications connect to Aurora PostgreSQL Limitless Database and issue a request, the request is first analyzed. Then, it is either sent to the compute instance that owns the shard key value specified by the request or a query across multiple instances is orchestrated.Multiple compute instances, each serving distinct shard key values, can simultaneously serve application requests for the same Aurora PostgreSQL Limitless Database. Aurora PostgreSQL Limitless Database provides the same transaction semantics as single-writer Aurora PostgreSQL systems, removing the complexity of managing different transaction domains in your application.

When you enable the MQAR feature for your distribution, you authorize CloudFront to automatically select the origin that is deemed to have the highest quality score. The quality score represents perceived media streaming quality issues from your origins, such as black frames, frozen or dropped frames, or repeated frames. For example, if your AWS Elemental MediaPackage v2 origins are deployed in two different AWS Regions, and one reports a higher media quality score than the other, CloudFront will automatically switch to the origin that reports the higher score. This feature simulates always-on eyes-on-glass to deliver live events and 24/7 programming channels, and is designed to help deliver a high quality of experience to your viewers.

{"instruction": "Answer the following AWS FAQ question", "input": "Can I choose to only serve content from less expensive Amazon CloudFront regions?", "output": "Yes, \"Price Classes\" provides you an option to lower the prices you pay to deliver content out of Amazon CloudFront. By default, Amazon CloudFront minimizes end user latency by delivering content from its entire global network of edge locations. However, because we charge more where our costs are higher, this means that you pay more to deliver your content with low latency to end-users in some locations. Price Classes let you reduce your delivery prices by excluding Amazon CloudFronts more expensive edge locations from your Amazon CloudFront distribution. In these cases, Amazon CloudFront will deliver your content from edge locations within the locations in the price class you selected and charge you the data transfer and request pricing from the actual location where the content was delivered.If performance is most important to you, you dont need to do anything; your content will be delivered by our whole network of locations. However, if you wish to use another Price Class, you can configure your distribution through the AWS Management Console or via the Amazon CloudFront API. If you select a price class that does not include all locations, some of your viewers, especially those in geographic locations that are not in your price class, may experience higher latency than if your content were being served from all Amazon CloudFront locations.Note that Amazon CloudFront may still occasionally serve requests for your content from an edge location in a location that is not included in your price class. When this occurs, you will only be charged the rates for the least expensive location in your price class.You can see the list of locations making up each price classhere (https://aws.amazon.com/cloudfront/pricing/).

These limits are expressed in the form of a credit bucket that is associated with an FSR-enabled snapshot in a given AZ. The important things to know regarding credits:1. A single volume create operation consumes a single credit2. The number of credits is a function of the FSR-enabled snapshot size3. Credits refill over time4. Maximum credit bucket size is 10To estimate your credit bucket size and fill rate, divide 1,024 by your snapshot size. For example, a 100 GiB FSR-enabled snapshot will have the maximum balance of 10 credits with a fill rate of 10 credits every hour. A 4 TiB snapshot will have a maximum balance of 1 with a fill rate of 1 credit every 4 hours.It's important to note that the credit bucket size is a function of the FSR-enabled snapshot size, not the size of the volumes that are created. For example, it is possible to create up to ten 1TiB volumes from a 100GiB snapshot at once.Lastly, each AZ in which the snapshot is FSR-enabled gets its own credit bucket independent of other AZs.

{"instruction": "Answer the following AWS FAQ question", "input": "What are the performance benefits of ElastiCache?", "output": "There are several performance benefits.ElastiCache provides enhanced I/O threads that deliver significant improvements to throughput and latency at scale through multiplexing, presentation layer offloading, and more. Enhanced I/O threads improve performance by using more cores for processing I/O and dynamically adjusting to the workload. ElastiCache improves the throughput of TLS-enabled clusters by offloading encryption to the same enhanced I/O threads. This enables ElastiCache for Valkey to deliver up to 100% more throughput and 50% lower P99 latency than ElastiCache version 7.0 for Redis OSS. You can achieve over 1 million requests per second per node, or 500 million request per second per cluster, on r7g.4xlarge nodes or larger.In addition, with ElastiCache version 8.0 for Valkey provides you improved memory efficiency for node-based clusters with Cluster Mode, using 32 bytes less memory per key compared to ElastiCache version 7.2 for Valkey and version 7.1 for Redis OSS. The Serverless configuration has enhanced performance, scaling to 5 million requests per second per cache in minutes, up to 5x faster than Valkey 7.2, with microsecond read latency.

{"instruction": "Answer the following AWS FAQ question", "input": "What are the Amazon S3 storage classes?", "output": "S3 Storage Classes can be configured at the object level and a single bucket can contain objects stored across all of the storage classes. You can also use S3 Lifecycle policies to automatically transition objects between storage classes without any application changes.Q: How do I decide which S3 storage class to use?In deciding whichS3 storage classbest fits your workload, consider the access patterns and retention time of your data to optimize for the lowest total cost over the lifetime of your data. Many workloads have changing (user-generated content), unpredictable (analytics, data lakes), or unknown (new applications) access patterns, and that is why S3 Intelligent-Tiering should be the default storage class to automatically save on storage costs. If you know the access patterns of your data, you can follow this guidance. The S3 Standard storage class is ideal for frequently accessed data; this is the best choice if you access data more than once a month. S3 Standard-Infrequent Access is ideal for data retained for at least a month and accessed once every month or two. [Source: https://aws.amazon.com/s3/faqs/]"}

{"instruction": "Answer the following AWS FAQ question", "input": "How does CloudHSM work?", "output": "To use the AWS CloudHSM service, you first create a CloudHSM Cluster. Clusters can contain multiple HSMs that are spread across multiple Availability Zones (AZs) in a region. HSMs in a cluster are automatically synchronized and load-balanced. You receive dedicated, single-tenant access to each HSM in your cluster and each HSM appears as a network resource in your Amazon Virtual Private Cloud (VPC). Adding and removing HSMs from your cluster is a single call to the AWS CloudHSM API (or on the command line using the AWS CLI). After creating and initializing a CloudHSM Cluster, you can configure a client on your EC2 instance that allows your applications to use the cluster over a secure, authenticated network connection. AWS CloudHSM automatically monitors the health of your HSMs, but no AWS personnel have access to your keys or data. Your applications use standard cryptographic APIs, in conjunction with HSM client software installed on the application instance, to send cryptographic requests to the HSM. The client software maintains a secure channel to all of the HSMs in your cluster and sends requests on this channel, and the HSM performs the operations and returns the results over the secure channel. The client then returns the result to the application through the cryptographic API. [Source: https://aws.amazon.com/cloudhsm/faqs/]"}

{"instruction": "Answer the following AWS FAQ question", "input": "How do S3 Multi-Region Access Points work?", "output": "Multi-Region Access Points dynamically route client requests to one or more underlying S3 buckets. You can configure your Multi-Region Access Point to route across one bucket per AWS Region, in up to 17 AWS Regions. When you create a Multi-Region Access Point, S3 automatically generates a DNS-compatible name. This name is used as a global endpoint that can be used by your clients. When your clients make requests to this endpoint, S3 will dynamically route those requests to one of the underlying buckets that are specified in the configuration of your Multi-Region Access Point.Internet-based requests are onboarded to the AWS global network to avoid congested network segments on the internet, which reduces network latency and jitter while improving performance. Based on AWS Global Accelerator, applications that access S3 over the internet can see performance further improved up to 60% by S3 Multi-Region Access Points.

{"instruction": "Answer the following AWS FAQ question", "input": "When should I use Kinesis Data Streams, and when should I use Amazon SQS?", "output": "We recommend Kinesis Data Streams for use cases with requirements that are similar to the following:Routing related records to the same record processor (as in streaming MapReduce).For example, counting and aggregation are simpler when all records for a given key are routed to the same record processor.Ordering of records.For example, you want to transfer log data from the application host to the processing/archival host while maintaining the order of log statements.Ability for multiple applications to consume the same stream concurrently.For example, you have one application that updates a real-time dashboard and another that archives data to Amazon Redshift. You want both applications to consume data from the same stream concurrently and independently.Ability to consume records in the same order a few hours later.For example, you have a billing application and an audit application that runs a few hours behind the billing application. Because Kinesis Data Streams stores data for up to 365 days, you can run the audit application up to 365 days behind the billing application.We recommend Amazon SQS for use cases with requirements that are similar to the following:Messaging semantics (such as message-level ack/fail) and visibility timeout.For example, you have a queue of work items and want to track the successful completion of each item independently. Amazon SQS tracks the ack/fail so the application doesnt have to maintain a persistent checkpoint/cursor. Amazon SQS will delete acked messages and redeliver failed messages after a configured visibility timeout.Individual message delay.For example, you have a job queue and need to schedule individual jobs with a delay. With Amazon SQS, you can configure individual messages to have a delay of up to 15 minutes.Dynamically increasing concurrency/throughput at read time.For example, you have a work queue and want to add more readers until the backlog is cleared. With Kinesis Data Streams, you can scale up to a sufficient number of shards (note, however, that youll need to provision enough shards ahead of time).Using the ability of Amazon SQS to scale transparently.For example, you buffer requests and the load changes as a result of occasional load spikes or the natural growth of your business. Because each buffered request can be processed independently, Amazon SQS can scale transparently to handle the load without any provisioning instructions from you.

{"instruction": "Answer the following AWS FAQ question", "input": "What factors can affect the performance consistency I see with Provisioned IOPS SSD (io2 Block Express and io1) volumes?", "output": "Provisioned IOPS SSD (io2 Block Express and io1) volumes attached to EBS-optimized instances are designed to offer consistent performance, delivering within 10% of the provisioned IOPS performance 99.9% of the time over a given year. For maximum performance consistency with new volumes created from a snapshot, we recommend enabling Fast Snapshot Restore (FSR) on your snapshots. EBS volumes restored from FSR-enabled snapshots instantly receive their full performance.\nAnother factor that can impact your performance is if your application isn\u2019t sending enough I/O requests. This can be monitored by looking at your volume\u2019s queue depth. The queue depth is the number of pending I/O requests from your application to your volume. For maximum consistency, a Provisioned IOPS volume must maintain an average queue depth (rounded to the nearest whole number) of one for every 1000 provisioned IOPS in a minute. For example, for a volume provisioned with 3000 IOPS, the queue depth average must be 3. For more information about ensuring consistent performance of your volumes, see Increasing EBS Performance.

{"instruction": "Answer the following AWS FAQ question", "input": "How does Amazon S3 File Gateway manage the local cache? What data gets stored locally?", "output": "Local disk storage on the gateway is used to temporarily hold changed data that needs to be transferred to AWS, and to locally cache data for low-latency read access. File Gateway automatically manages the cache maintaining the most recently accessed data based on client read and write operations. Data is evicted from the cache only when space is needed to store more recently used data.To maximize write performance, the gateway uses a write-back mechanism where data is first persisted to disk and then asynchronously uploaded to S3. The gateway serves data from the local cache to maximize read performance. If not present, data is efficiently synchronously fetched from Amazon S3 using byte-range gets.The local cache should generally be sized for the working set of data that you need low-latency access to. If the cache is too small then read latencies will increase as data being requested must be fetched from S3, and writes could fail if there is no free cache space to store data locally pending upload to S3.

{"instruction": "Answer the following AWS FAQ question", "input": "What is Auto Discovery and what can I do with it?", "output": "Auto Discovery is a feature that saves developers time and effort, while reducing the complexity of their applications. Auto Discovery enables automatic discovery of cache nodes by clients when they are added to or removed from an ElastiCache cluster. Previously, to handle cluster membership changes, developers had to manually update the list of cache node endpoints. Depending on how the client application is architected, typically a client initialization (by shutting down the application and restarting it) is needed, resulting in downtime. Through Auto Discovery, ElastiCache removes this complexity. With Auto Discovery, in addition to being backwards protocol compliant with the Memcached protocol, ElastiCache provides clients with information on cache cluster membership. A client capable of processing the additional information reconfigures itself, without any initialization, to use the most current nodes of an ElastiCache cluster.

{"instruction": "Answer the following AWS FAQ question", "input": "TCO comparison between Amazon EFS and a provisioned cloud solution", "output": "The example solution below illustrates the Amazon EFS TCO and the effective TCO of Amazon EFS considering storage and throughput elasticity. With Amazon EFS, storage and throughput scales up and down automatically, and you never pay for unused storage or throughput capacity. EFS automatically replicates data across multiple AZs for high availability and durability, and automatically tiers the data across hot and cold storage classes to optimize costs.\nAlternatively, a non-elastic (provisioned) cloud solution requires you to manage storage and throughput capacity at the peak usage and doesn\u2019t allow for a capacity reduction. Most provisioned solution providers recommend to maintain a 30-50% storage utilization to account for storage growth and a 50% throughput utilization to account for spiky throughput. If we compare EFS\u2019s elastic model, which doesn\u2019t require any additional unused storage or throughput, the effective TCO is up to 60% cheaper.\nExample 1 - General Purpose workload Assume that your file system is located in the US East (N. Virginia) Region and contains an average storage size of 2.7 TB for a given month. Your application performs bursts of read operations with a peak throughput of 25 MBps, totaling 300 GB of data transferred within a month.\nWith EFS, this application would store an average 5% of the storage (145 TB) in SSD, ~20% of storage (527 TB) in Infrequent Access, and the remaining 2,027 TB of storage in Archive, totaling $68.47 for storage costs. Additionally, the workload is charged $2.50 for tiering the colder data to the Infrequent Access and Archive classes, and $14.00 for Elastic Throughput costs to transfer 300 GB of data, delivering a TCO of $0.0315/GB-mo.\nWith a Provisioned cloud solution, the application can benefit from storage optimizations such as compression to reduce the total storage size by 50% (1,350 TB). Based on the usage patterns, we expect 5% of the hot data (68 TB) to be stored in SSD. Since this is a provisioned cloud solution and doesn\u2019t automatically scale up/down, we recommend to operate at 50% storage utilization and provision 136 TB. The remaining 95% of the storage (1,282 TB) is stored in a colder storage class, equaling $90.15 for storage costs. Additionally, we provision 50 MBps for throughput based on the recommendation to operate throughput at 50% utilization, delivering a TCO of $0.0797/GB-mo.\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n EFS \n Provisioned solution  \n\n\n Storage \n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\n\n Average Total Storage (GB-mo) \n 2,700 \n 2,700 \n\n\n Average Total Paid Storage (GB-mo) \n 2,700 \n *1,350 \n\n\n SSD-based storage (GB-mo) \n 145 \n **136 \n\n\n IA Storage (GB-mo) \n 527 \n **1,282 \n\n\n Archive Storage (GB-mo) \n 2,027 \n 0 \n\n\n SSD Storage ($/mo) \n $43.55 \n $34.00 \n\n\n Cold Storage ($/mo) \n $8.70 \n $56.15 \n\n\n Archive Storage ($/mo) \n $16.22 \n\u00a0\n\n\n Total storage cost \n $68.47 \n $90.15 \n\n\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\n\n Data Tiering \n $2.50 \n \u00a0 \n\n\n \u00a0 \n \u00a0 \n \u00a0 \n\n\n Throughput \n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\n\n Throughput provisioned (MBps) \n \u00a0 \n ***50 \n\n\n Total data transferred (GB) \n 300 \n \u00a0 \n\n\n Throughput Cost \n $14.00 \n $125.00 \n\n\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\n\n Total Cost \n $84.97 \n $215.15 \n\n\n Effective $/GB \n $0.0315 \n $0.0797 \n\n\n EFS Savings (%) \n 60% \n\n\n\n *Assumes a 50% storage reduction benefit from optimizations such as compression\n**Assumes 5% of the compressed data is stored in the SSD class, provisioned to run at 50% utilization, and charged at a rate of $0.25/GB-mo.

Text detection is specifically built to work with real-world images and videos, rather than document images. Amazon Rekognition\u2019s DetectText API takes in an image and returns the text label and a bounding box for each detected string of characters, along with a confidence score. For example, in image sharing and social media applications, you can enable visual search based on an index of images that contain the same text labels. In security applications, you can identify vehicles based on license plate numbers from images taken by traffic cams. Similarly, for videos, using the StartTextDetection and GetTextDetection APIs, you can detect text and get confidence scores and timestamps for each detection. In media and entertainment applications, you can create text metadata to support search for relevant content, such as news, sport scores, commercials, and captions. You can also review the detected text for policy or compliance violations e.g. an email address or phone number that has been overlaid by spammers.

Task lists are Amazon SWF resources into which initiated tasks are added and from which tasks are requested. Task lists are identified by user-defined names. A task list may have tasks of different type-ids, but they must all be either activity tasks or decision tasks. During registration, you specify a default task list for each activity and workflow type. Amazon SWF also lets you create task lists at run time. You create a task list simply by naming it and starting to use it. You use task lists as follows:While initiating an activity task, a decider can add it into a specific task list or request Amazon SWF to add it into the default task list for its activity type.While starting an execution, you can request Amazon SWF to add all of its decision tasks to a specific task list or to the default task list for the workflow type.While requesting tasks, deciders and workers specify which task list they want to receive tasks from. If a task is available in the list, SWF sends it in the response and also includes its type-id.Based on the above, you control which task list a task gets added into and who asks for tasks from each list.

{"instruction": "Answer the following AWS FAQ question", "input": "How can I rotate my keys?", "output": "Your rotation strategy will depend on your type of application. Common examples are below.Private keys for signing: Generally, the private key on the HSM corresponds to an intermediate certificate, which is in turn signed by an offline enterprise root. You will rotate keys by issuing a new intermediate certificate. Create anew private key and generate the corresponding CSR using OpenSSL (https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cloudhsm/latest/userguide/ssl-offload-import-or-generate-private-key-and-certificate.html)on AWS CloudHSM. Next, sign the CSR with the same offline enterprise root. You may have to register this new certificate with any partners who do not automatically verify the entire certificate chain. Moving forward, you would sign all new requests (such as for documents, code, or other certificates) with the new private key, corresponding to the new certificate. You can continue to verify signatures from the original private key using the corresponding public key. No revocation is necessary. This process is analogous to the process you would follow to retire or archive a signing key.Oracle Transparent Data Encryption: You can transfer your wallet by first switching from a hardware keystore (your original HSM) to asoftware keystore (https://docs.oracle.com/database/121/ASOAG/configuring-transparent-data-encryption.htm#ASOAG10474), and then back to ahardware keystore (https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cloudhsm/latest/userguide/oracle-tde-configure-database-and-generate-master-key.html)(AWS CloudHSM).Note: If you are using Amazon RDS, see the above FAQDoes AWS CloudHSM support Amazon RDS Oracle TDE? (https://aws.amazon.com/cloudhsm/faqs/#tde)Symmetric key for envelope encryption: Envelope encryption refers to the key architecture where one key on the HSM encrypts/decrypts many data keys on the application host. You likely already have a key rotation process in place to go through and decrypt the data keys with the old wrapping key and re-encrypt them with the new wrapping key. The only difference during migration will be that the new wrapping key will be created and used on AWS CloudHSM instead of your original HSM. If you do not already have a key rotation tool and process in place, you will need to create one. [Source: https://aws.amazon.com/cloudhsm/faqs/]"}

{"instruction": "Answer the following AWS FAQ question", "input": "How does Amazon EBS handle issues like storage contention?", "output": "EBS is a multi-tenant block storage service. We employ rate limiting as a mechanism to avoid resource contention. This starts with having defined performance criteria for the volumes \u2013 our volume types (gp2, PIOPS, st1, and sc1) all have defined performance characteristics in terms of IOPS and throughput. The next step is defining performance at the instance level. Each EBS Optimized instance has defined performance (both throughput and IOPS) for the set of EBS volumes attached to the instance. A customer can, therefore, size instances and volumes to get the desired level of performance. In addition, customers can use our reported metrics to observe instance level and volume level performance. They can set alarms to determine if what they are seeing does not match the expected performance \u2013 the metrics can also help determine if customers are configured at the right type of instance with the right amount of performance at the volume level or not. On the EBS end, we use the configured performance to inform how we allocate the appropriate instance and EBS infrastructure to support the volumes. By appropriately allocating infrastructure, we avoid resource contention. Additionally, we constantly monitor our infrastructure. This monitoring allows us to detect infrastructure failure (or imminent infrastructure failure) and therefore, move the volumes pro-actively to functioning hardware while the underlying infrastructure is either repaired or replaced (as appropriate).

SSD-backed volumes are designed for transactional, IOPS-intensive database workloads, boot volumes, and workloads that require high IOPS. SSD-backed volumes include Provisioned IOPS SSD (io2 Block Express and io1) and General Purpose SSD (gp3 and gp2). Io2 Block Express of the Provisioned IOPS SSD volumes is designed to provide 100X durability of 99.999%, making it ideal for business-critical applications that need higher uptime. Gp3 is the latest generation of General Purpose SSD volumes that provides the right balance of price and performance for most applications that dont require the highest IOPS performance or 99.999% durability. HDD-backed volumes are designed for throughput-intensive and big-data workloads, large I/O sizes, and sequential I/O patterns.

{"instruction": "Answer the following AWS FAQ question", "input": "What are the key benefits of using HTTP/3 with Amazon CloudFront?", "output": "Customers are constantly looking to deliver faster and more secure applications for their end users. As internet penetration increases globally and more users come online via mobile and from remote networks, the need for improved performance and reliability is greater than ever. HTTP/3 enables this as it offers several performance improvements over previous HTTP versions:Faster and reliable connections- CloudFront uses 1-RTT for TLS handshake for HTTP/3 reducing the connection establishment time and a corresponding reduction in handshake failure compared to previous HTTP versions.Better web performance- CloudFronts HTTP/3 implementation supports client-side connection migrations, allowing client applications to recover from poor connections with minimal interruptions. Unlike TCP, QUIC is not lossless making it better suited for congested networks with high packet loss. Also, QUIC allows faster re-connections during Wifi or cellular handoffs.Security- HTTP/3 offers more comprehensive security compared to previous versions of HTTP by encrypting packets exchanged during TLS handshakes. This makes inspection by middleboxes harder providing additional privacy, and reducing man-in-the-middle attacks. CloudFront's HTTP/3 support is built on top of s2n-quic and Rust, both with a strong emphasis on efficiency and performance. [Source: https://aws.amazon.com/cloudfront/faqs/]"}

{"instruction": "Answer the following AWS FAQ question", "input": "Can Amazon SNS be used with other AWS services?", "output": "Amazon SNS can be used with other AWS services such as Amazon SQS, Amazon EC2 and Amazon S3. Here is an example of how an order processing workflow system uses Amazon SNS with Amazon EC2, SQS, and SimpleDB. In this workflow system, messages are sent between application components whenever a transaction occurs or an order advances through the order processing pipeline. When a customer initially places an order, the transaction is first recorded in Amazon SimpleDB and an application running on Amazon EC2 forwards the order request to a payment processor which debits the customer\u2019s credit card or bank account. Once approved, an order confirmation message is published to an Amazon SNS topic. In this case, the topic has various subscribers over Email/HTTP \u2013 merchant, customer and supply chain partners \u2013 and notifications sent by Amazon SNS for that topic can instantly update all of them that payment processing was successful. Notifications can also be used to orchestrate an order processing system running on EC2, where notifications sent over HTTP can trigger real-time processing in related components such as an inventory system or a shipping service. By integrating Amazon SNS with Amazon SQS, all notifications delivered are also persisted in an Amazon SQS queue where they are processed by an auditing application at a future time.

{"instruction": "Answer the following AWS FAQ question", "input": "What happens if the capacity limits of an Amazon Kinesis data stream are exceeded while the data producer adds data to the data stream in provisioned mode?", "output": "In provisioned mode, the capacity limits of a Kinesis data stream are defined by the number of shards within the data stream. The limits can be exceeded either by data throughput or by the number of PUT records. While the capacity limits are exceeded, the put data call will be rejected with a ProvisionedThroughputExceeded exception. If this is due to a temporary rise of the data streams input data rate, retry by the data producer will eventually lead to completion of the requests. If its due to a sustained rise of the data streams input data rate, you should increase the number of shards within your data stream to provide enough capacity for the put data calls to consistently succeed. In both cases, Amazon CloudWatch metrics allow you to learn about the change of the data streams input data rate and the occurrence of ProvisionedThroughputExceeded exceptions.

{"instruction": "Answer the following AWS FAQ question", "input": "Does the number of identities in the Cognito identity pools console tell me how many users are using my app?", "output": "The number of identities in the Cognito identity pools console shows you how many identities were created via the Cognito identity pools APIs. For Authenticated Identities (those logging in with a login provider such as Facebook or an OpenID Connect provider), each call to Cognito identity pools GetId API will only ever create a single identity for each user. However, for unauthenticated identities, each time the client in an app calls the GetId API will generate a new identity. Therefore, if your app calls GetId for unauthenticated identities multiple times for a single user it will appear that a single user has multiple identities. So, it is important that you cache the response from GetId when using unauthenticated identities and not call it multiple times per user.The Mobile SDK provides the logic to cache the Cognito identity pools data automatically so you don't have to worry about this.

{"instruction": "Answer the following AWS FAQ question", "input": "What is Amazon S3 File Gateway?", "output": "Amazon S3 File Gateway presents a file-based interface to Amazon S3, which appears as a network file share. It enables you to store and retrieve Amazon S3 objects through standard file storage protocols. File Gateway allows your existing file-based applications or devices to use secure and durable cloud storage without needing to be modified. With S3 File Gateway, your configured S3 buckets will be available as Network File System (NFS) mount points or Server Message Block (SMB) file shares. Your applications read and write files and directories over NFS or SMB, interfacing to the gateway as a file server. In turn, the gateway translates these file operations into object requests on your S3 buckets. Your most recently used data is cached on the gateway for low-latency access, and data transfer between your data center and AWS is fully managed and optimized by the gateway. Once in S3, you can access the objects directly or manage them using S3 features such as S3 Lifecycle Policies and S3 Cross-Region Replication (CRR). You can run S3 File Gateway on-premises or in EC2. [Source: https://aws.amazon.com/storagegateway/faqs/]"}

{"instruction": "Answer the following AWS FAQ question", "input": "What are some use cases that can be solved with Amazon SWF?", "output": "Amazon SWF has been applied to use cases in media processing, business process automation, data analytics, migration to the cloud, and batch processing. Some examples are:Use case #1: Video encoding using Amazon S3 and Amazon EC2. In this use case, large videos are uploaded to Amazon S3 in chunks. The upload of chunks has to be monitored. After a chunk is uploaded, it is encoded by downloading it to an Amazon EC2 instance. The encoded chunk is stored to another Amazon S3 location. After all of the chunks have been encoded in this manner, they are combined into a complete encoded file which is stored back in its entirety to Amazon S3. Failures could occur during this process due to one or more chunks encountering encoding errors. Such failures need to be detected and handled.With Amazon SWF: The entire application is built as a workflow where each video file is handled as one workflow execution. The tasks that are processed by different workers are: upload a chunk to Amazon S3, download a chunk from Amazon S3 to an Amazon EC2 instance and encode it, store a chunk back to Amazon S3, combine multiple chunks into a single file, and upload a complete file to Amazon S3. The decider initiates concurrent tasks to exploit the parallelism in the use case. It initiates a task to encode an uploaded chunk without waiting for other chunks to be uploaded. If a task for a chunk fails, the decider re-runs it for that chunk only. The application state kept by Amazon SWF helps the decider control the workflow. For example, the decider uses it to detect when all chunks have been encoded and to extract their Amazon S3 locations so that they can be combined. The executions progress is continuously tracked in the Amazon SWF Management Console. If there are failures, the specific tasks that failed are identified and used to pinpoint the failed chunks.Use case #2: Processing large product catalogs using Amazon Mechanical Turk. While validating data in large catalogs, the products in the catalog are processed in batches. Different batches can be processed concurrently. For each batch, the product data is extracted from servers in the datacenter and transformed into CSV (Comma Separated Values) files required by Amazon Mechanical Turks Requester User Interface (RUI). The CSV is uploaded to populate and run the HITs (Human Intelligence Tasks). When HITs complete, the resulting CSV file is reverse transformed to get the data back into the original format. The results are then assessed and Amazon Mechanical Turk workers are paid for acceptable results. Failures are weeded out and reprocessed, while the acceptable HIT results are used to update the catalog. As batches are processed, the system needs to track the quality of the Amazon Mechanical Turk workers and adjust the payments accordingly. Failed HITs are re-batched and sent through the pipeline again.With Amazon SWF: The use case above is implemented as a set of workflows. A BatchProcess workflow handles the processing for a single batch. It has workers that extract the data, transform it and send it through Amazon Mechanical Turk. The BatchProcess workflow outputs the acceptable HITs and the failed ones. This is used as the input for three other workflows: MTurkManager, UpdateCatalogWorkflow, and RerunProducts. The MTurkManager workflow makes payments for acceptable HITs, responds to the human workers who produced failed HITs, and updates its own database for tracking results quality. The UpdateCatalogWorkflow updates the master catalog based on acceptable HITs. The RerunProducts workflow waits until there is a large enough batch of products with failed HITs. It then creates a batch and sends it back to the BatchProcess workflow. The entire end-to-end catalog processing is performed by a CleanupCatalog workflow that initiates child executions of the above workflows. Having a system of well-defined workflows enables this use case to be architected, audited, and run systematically for catalogs with several million products.Use case #3: Migrating components from the datacenter to the cloud. Business critical operations are hosted in a private datacenter but need to be moved entirely to the cloud without causing disruptions.With Amazon SWF: Amazon SWF-based applications can combine workers that wrap components running in the datacenter with workers that run in the cloud. To transition a datacenter worker seamlessly, new workers of the same type are first deployed in the cloud. The workers in the datacenter continue to run as usual, along with the new cloud-based workers. The cloud-based workers are tested and validated by routing a portion of the load through them. During this testing, the application is not disrupted because the workers in the datacenter continue to run. After successful testing, the workers in the datacenter are gradually stopped and those in the cloud are scaled up, so that the workers are eventually run entirely in the cloud. This process can be repeated for all other workers in the datacenter so that the application moves entirely to the cloud. If for some business reason, certain processing steps must continue to be performed in the private data center, those workers can continue to run in the private data center and still participate in the application.See our case studies for more exciting applications and systems that developers and enterprises are building with Amazon SWF.

{"instruction": "Answer the following AWS FAQ question", "input": "What is a launch configuration?", "output": "A launch configuration is a template that an EC2 Auto Scaling group uses to launch EC2 instances. When you create a launch configuration, you specify information for the instances such as the ID of the Amazon Machine Image (AMI), the instance type, a key pair, one or more security groups, and a block device mapping. If you've launched an EC2 instance before, you specified the same information in order to launch the instance. When you create an EC2 Auto Scaling group, you must specify a launch configuration. You can specify your launch configuration with multiple EC2 Auto Scaling groups. However, you can only specify one launch configuration for an EC2 Auto Scaling group at a time, and you can't modify a launch configuration after you've created it. Therefore, if you want to change the launch configuration for your EC2 Auto Scaling group, you must create a launch configuration and then update your EC2 Auto Scaling group with the new launch configuration. When you change the launch configuration for your EC2 Auto Scaling group, any new instances are launched using the new configuration parameters, but existing instances are not affected.

{"instruction": "Answer the following AWS FAQ question", "input": "When I request a certificate and choose email validation, to which email addresses is the certificate approval request sent?", "output": "When you request a certificate using email validation, a WHOIS lookup for each domain name in the certificate request is used to retrieve contact information for the domain. Email is sent to the domain registrant, administrative contact, and technical contact listed for the domain. Email is also sent to five special email addresses, which are formed by prepending admin@, administrator@, hostmaster@, webmaster@ and postmaster@ to the domain name youre requesting. For example, if you request a certificate for server.example.com, email is sent to the domain registrant, technical contact, and administrative contact using contact information returned by a WHOIS query for the example.com domain, plus admin@server.example.com, administrator@server.example.com, hostmaster@server.example.com, postmaster@server.example.com, and webmaster@server.example.com.The five special email addresses are constructed differently for domain names that begin with \"www\" or wildcard names beginning with an asterisk (*). ACM removes the leading \"www\" or asterisk and email is sent to the administrative addresses formed by pre-pending admin@, administrator@, hostmaster@, postmaster@, and webmaster@ to the remaining portion of the domain name. For example, if you request a certificate for www.example.com, email is sent to the WHOIS contacts, as described previously, plus admin@example.com rather than admin@www.example.com. The remaining four special email addresses are similarly formed.After you request a certificate, you can display the list of email addresses to which the email was sent for each domain using the ACM console, AWS CLI, or APIs.

{"instruction": "Answer the following AWS FAQ question", "input": "Do managed clusters that use Multi-AZ with Standby need to be sized differently? How do we size managed clusters for Multi-AZ with Standby?", "output": "No. In principle, the sizing guidelines remain the same. Multi-AZ with Standby has pre-requisites that simplify the mental model required to size the cluster. The way to think of sizing for managed cluster is that you should look at the capacity needed to service your workload and then add 50% for redundancy. The primary difference between the current Zone Awareness option and the Multi-AZ with Standby option is how redundant or additional capacity is handled to maintain availability. Multi-AZ with Standby requires you have at least one copy of data in each AZ, so that Multi-AZ with Standby can explicitly reserve capacity in one AZ as standby. This standby capacity acts as a failover target during AZ disruption or instance failure. The existing model requires that you maintain an optimum levels of resources to serve your workload. You would continue to monitor your cluster for sizing issues and take corrective actions as the workload characteristics changes. [Source: https://aws.amazon.com/opensearch-service/faqs/]"}

{"instruction": "Answer the following AWS FAQ question", "input": "What factors can affect the performance consistency of my HDD-backed volumes?", "output": "Throughput Optimized HDD (st1) and Cold HDD (sc1) volumes attached to EBS-optimized instances are designed to offer consistent performance, delivering within 10% of the expected throughput performance 99% of the time in a given year. There are several factors that could affect the level of consistency you see. For example, the relative balance between random and sequential I/O operations on the volume can impact your performance. Too many random small I/O operations will quickly deplete your I/O credits and lower your performance down to the baseline rate. Your throughput rate may also be lower depending on the instance selected. Although st1 can drive throughput up to 500 MB/s, performance will be limited by the separate instance-level limit for EBS traffic. Another factor is taking a snapshot which will decrease expected write performance down to the baseline rate, until the snapshot completes. This is specific to st1 and sc1.\nYour performance can also be impacted if your application isn\u2019t sending enough I/O requests. This can be monitored by looking at your volume\u2019s queue depth and I/O size. The queue depth is the number of pending I/O requests from your application to your volume. For maximum consistency, HDD-backed volumes must maintain an average queue depth (rounded to the nearest whole number) of four or more for every 1 MB sequential I/O.

{"instruction": "Answer the following AWS FAQ question", "input": "What are the best practices to accelerate domain configuration and re-indexing?", "output": "When you change the configuration options of your search domain, you must rebuild your search index for those changes to take effect in search results. Rebuilding the index can take 30 to 60 minutes whether you make one configuration change at a time or several configuration changes at once. Even if your domain has only a small number of documents, re-indexing takes this time because of the processing and provisioning necessary to build the index and distribute it. Therefore, you should plan your configuration changes ahead of time, make all of your changes at once, and then re-index your domain. The same applies when setting up a new domain - plan your configuration before you set it up so that you can index only once and get up and running in the shortest time possible.Some domain changes require re-indexing while others just require re-deploying the existing index. Redeploying the domain takes 10 to 15 minutes compared to 30-60 minutes for re-indexing. During re-deployment, CloudSearch creates new nodes, deploys the index on them, and shuts down the old nodes. Your domain status changes to \u201cProcessing\u201d during re-deployment. When re-indexing is needed, your domain status changes to \u201cNeeds Indexing,\u201d followed by \u201cProcessing\u201d once you have initiated indexing. Once the new index is created, your domain is re-deployed. The following table summarizes which changes require re-indexing followed by re-deployment and which changes require just re-deployment. Understanding this will help you better plan your configuration changes. [Source: https://aws.amazon.com/cloudsearch/faqs/]"}

{"instruction": "Answer the following AWS FAQ question", "input": "How is a computation done in Amazon EMR?", "output": "Amazon EMR uses the Hadoop data processing engine to conduct computations implemented in the MapReduce programming model. The customer implements their algorithm in terms of map() and reduce() functions. The service starts a customer-specified number of Amazon EC2 instances, comprised of one master and multiple other nodes. Amazon EMR runs Hadoop software on these instances. The master node divides input data into blocks, and distributes the processing of the blocks to the other nodes. Each node then runs the map function on the data it has been allocated, generating intermediate data. The intermediate data is then sorted and partitioned and sent to processes which apply the reducer function to it locally on the nodes. Finally, the output from the reducer tasks is collected in files. A single \u201ccluster\u201d may involve a sequence of such MapReduce steps. [Source: https://aws.amazon.com/emr/faqs/]"}

If a certificate cannot be renewed without additional validation, ACM manages the renewal process by validating domain ownership or control for each domain name in the certificate. After each domain name in the certificate has been validated, ACM renews the certificate and automatically deploys it with your AWS resources. If ACM cannot validate domain ownership, we will let you (the AWS account owner) know.If you chose DNS validation in your certificate request, ACM can renew your certificate indefinitely without any further action from you, as long as the certificate is in use (associated with other AWS resources) and your CNAME record remains in place. If you selected email validation when requesting a certificate, you can improve ACMs ability to automatically renew and deploy ACM certificates, by ensuring that the certificate is in use, that all domain names included in the certificate can be resolved to your site, and that all domain names are reachable from the Internet.Private CertificatesACM provides two options for managing private certificates issued with AWS Private CA. ACM provides different renewal capabilities depending on how you are managing your private certificates. You can choose the best management option for each private certificate you issue.1) ACM can fully automate renewal and deployment of private certificates issued with AWS Private CAs and used with ACM-integrated services, such as Elastic Load Balancing and API Gateway. ACM can renew and deploy private certificates that are issued through ACM as long as the private CA that issued the certificate remains in the Active state.2) For private certificates you export from ACM for use with on-premises resources, EC2 instances, and IoT devices, ACM renews your certificate automatically.

For example, system and application logs can be continuously added to a data stream and be available for processing within seconds.Real-time metrics and reporting:You can extract metrics and generate reports from Kinesis data stream data in real time. For example, your Amazon Kinesis application can work on metrics and reporting for system and application logs as the data is streaming in, rather than waiting to receive data batches.Real-time data analytics:With Kinesis Data Streams, you can run real-time streaming data analytics. For example, you can add clickstreams to your Kinesis data stream and have your Kinesis application run analytics in real time, allowing you to gain insights from your data in minutes instead of hours or days.Log and event data collection:Collect log and event data from sources such as servers, desktops, and mobile devices. You can then build applications using Amazon Lambda orAmazon Managed Service for Apache Flink to continuously process the data, generate metrics, power live dashboards, and emit aggregated data into stores such as Amazon Simple Storage Service (Amazon S3).Power event-driven applications:Quickly pair with AWS Lambda to respond or adjust to immediate occurrences within the event-driven applications in your environment, at any scale.

{"instruction": "Answer the following AWS FAQ question", "input": "I am already using SSL/ TLS encryption with CloudFront, do I still need Field-Level Encryption?", "output": "Many web applications collect sensitive data such as credit card numbers from users that is then processed by application services running on the origin infrastructure. All these web applications use SSL/TLS encryption between the end user and CloudFront, and between CloudFront and your origin. Now, your origin could have multiple micro-services that perform critical operations based on user input. However, typically sensitive information only needs to be used by a small subset of these micro-services, which means most components have direct access to these data for no reason. A simple programming mistake, such as logging the wrong variable could lead to a customers credit card number being written to a file.With field-level encryption, CloudFronts edge locations can encrypt the credit card data. From that point on, only applications that have the private keys can decrypt the sensitive fields. So the order fulfillment service can only view encrypted credit card numbers, but the payment services can decrypt credit card data. This ensures a higher level of security since even if one of the application services leaks cipher text, the data remains cryptographically protected.

To set target values for your resource metrics, you can choose from three predefined scaling recommendations that optimize availability, optimize costs, or balance the two. Or, if you prefer, you can define your own target values. AWS Auto Scaling also automatically sets the min/max values for the resources. [Source: https://aws.amazon.com/autoscaling/faqs/]"}

{"instruction": "Answer the following AWS FAQ question", "input": "What file system operations are supported by Amazon S3 File Gateway?", "output": "Your clients can create, read, update, and delete files and directories.Your clients can also change permissions and ownership of files and folders. Files are stored as individual objects in Amazon S3. Directories are managed as folder objects in S3, using the same syntax as the S3 console. Symbolic links and hard links are not supported. Attempting to create a link will result in an error.Common file operations change file metadata, which results in the deletion of the current S3 object and the creation of a new S3 object.Rename operations will appear atomic to your clients, but S3 does not support renaming of objects. When you rename a file or directory the gateway performs copy-put requests to create a copy of the objects in S3 under the new keys and then deletes the original objects. This avoids having to re-send large files over the network. Renaming directories containing a large number of files is not instantaneous, will result in 2 copies of your data being stored in S3, and operations in the directories will be blocked until the rename operation completes.

{"instruction": "Answer the following AWS FAQ question", "input": "How does Amazon EBS handle issues like storage contention?", "output": "EBS is a multi-tenant block storage service. We employ rate limiting as a mechanism to avoid resource contention. This starts with having defined performance criteria for the volumes  our volume types (gp2, PIOPS, st1, and sc1) all have defined performance characteristics in terms of IOPS and throughput. The next step is defining performance at the instance level. Each EBS Optimized instance has defined performance (both throughput and IOPS) for the set of EBS volumes attached to the instance. A customer can, therefore, size instances and volumes to get the desired level of performance. In addition, customers can use our reported metrics to observe instance level and volume level performance. They can set alarms to determine if what they are seeing does not match the expected performance  the metrics can also help determine if customers are configured at the right type of instance with the right amount of performance at the volume level or not. On the EBS end, we use the configured performance to inform how we allocate the appropriate instance and EBS infrastructure to support the volumes. By appropriately allocating infrastructure, we avoid resource contention. Additionally, we constantly monitor our infrastructure. This monitoring allows us to detect infrastructure failure (or imminent infrastructure failure) and therefore, move the volumes pro-actively to functioning hardware while the underlying infrastructure is either repaired or replaced (as appropriate).

With EFS Replication, you pay for the storage, access charges from Infrequent Access and Archive classes, and data transfer changes if your destination file system is in a different AWS Region. With AWS Backup, you pay for the average amount of data backed up and restored in a month.\nReplication\nThis example reflects a scenario where you are replicating file systems across Regions using EFS Replication. The example is focused on costs directly related to EFS Replication.\nAssume you have an EFS file system in the US East (North Virginia) Region with 1 TB of data. This file system is being replicated to the US West (Oregon) Region. Assume the destination file system uses a 7-day EFS Lifecycle Management Policy to move files into the EFS IA class.\nWhen replication is first turned on, the entire source file system is copied to the destination file system. The replicated data will first land in the EFS Standard class in the destination file system. If files aren\u2019t accessed for the duration of the EFS Lifecycle Management policy (7 days), they will move to the EFS IA class.\nInitial sync:\nFirst, we calculate the pro-rated storage usage for the destination file system: Total EFS Standard usage (GB-hours): 1,000 GB * 7 days * (24 hours / day) = 168,000 GB-hours Total EFS IA usage (GB-hours): 1,000 GB * 24 days * (24 hours / day / 31-day month) = 576,000 GB-hours\nNext, we convert the storage usage into GB-months and calculate the storage charge for the destination file system:\nTotal EFS Standard charge: 168,000 * (1 month / 744 hours) * $0.30/GB-month = $67.74 Total EFS IA charge: 576,000 * (1 month / 744 hours) * $0.025/GB-month = $19.36 Total storage charges for initial sync = $67.74 + $19.36 = $87.10 Then we calculate the Data transfer charges for the source file system\u2019s initial replication to the destination file system: Total EFS Replication data transfer charges for 1 TB of data: 1,000 GB * $0.02/GB = $20.00\nTotal charges for initial sync = Total storage charges for initial sync + Total data transfer charges for initial\u00a0sync = $87.10 + $20.00 = $107.10\nIncremental replication:\nConsider that the source file systems add 150 GB of new data after 7 days. The new data will be replicated to the destination file system and will reside in the EFS Standard class for 7 days based on the Lifecycle Management Policy as before. The pro-rated storage usage for 150 GB of new data is calculated as follows:\nTotal EFS Standard usage (GB-hours): 150 GB * 7 days * (24 hours / day) = 25,200 GB-hours Total EFS IA usage (GB-hours): 150 GB * 17 days * (24 hours / day) = 61,200 GB-hours\nNext, we convert the storage usage into GB-months and calculate the storage charge for the 150 GB of new data added to the destination file system:\u00a0\nTotal EFS Standard charge: 25,200 * (1 month / 744 hours) * $0.30/GB-month = $10.16 Total EFS IA charge: 61,200 * (1 month / 744 hours) * $0.025/GB-month = $2.06 Total storage charges for incremental replication = $10.16 + $2.06 = $12.22\nLastly, we calculate the data transfer charges for 150 GB of incremental data:\nTotal data transfer charges for incremental replication: 150 GB * $0.02/GB = $3.00 Total charges for incremental replication = Total storage charges for incremental replication + Total data transfer charges for incremental replication = $12.22 + $3.00 = $15.22\nTotal charges related to EFS Replication = Total charges for initial sync + Total charges for incremental replication = $107.10 + $15.22 = $122.32\nBackup\nSee\u00a0AWS Backup Pricing for Backup pricing examples.\nFor more EFS pricing information, visit the\u00a0Amazon EFS Pricing page.

{"instruction": "Answer the following AWS FAQ question", "input": "How do I think about latency in Amazon Kinesis Video Streams?", "output": "There are four key contributors to latency in an end-to-end media data flow.Time spent in the devices hardware media pipeline: This pipeline can comprise of the image sensor and any hardware encoders as appropriate. In theory, this can be as little as a single frame duration. In practice it rarely is. All encoders in order to work effectively for media encoding (compression) will accumulate several frames to construct a fragment. This process and any corresponding motion compensation algorithms will add anywhere from one second to several seconds of latency on the device before the data is packaged for transmission.Latency incurred on actual data transmission on the internet: The quality of the network throughput and latency can vary significantly based on where the producing device is located.Latency added by the Kinesis Video Streams as it receives data from the producer device: The incoming data is made available immediately on theGetMedia API operation (https://docs.aws.amazon.com/kinesisvideostreams/latest/dg/API_dataplane_GetMedia.html)for any consuming application. If you choose to retain data, then Kinesis Video Streams will ensure that the data is encrypted using AWS Key Management Service (AWS KMS) and generate a time-based index on the individual fragments in the video stream. When you access this retained data using theGetMediaforFragmentList API (https://docs.aws.amazon.com/kinesisvideostreams/latest/dg/API_reader_GetMediaForFragmentList.html), Kinesis Video Streams fetches the fragments from durable storage, decrypt the data, and make it available for the consuming application.Time latency on data transmission back to the consumer: There can be consuming devices on the internet or other AWS regions that request the media data. The quality of the network throughput and latency can vary significantly based on where the consuming device is located. [Source: https://aws.amazon.com/kinesis/video-streams/faqs/]"}

{"instruction": "Answer the following AWS FAQ question", "input": "What is Time to Live (TTL)?", "output": "Some messages that you can send with SNS are relevant or valuable only for a limited period of time. Amazon SNS now allows you to set a TTL (Time to Live) value for each message. When the TTL expires for a given message that was not delivered and read by an end user, the message is deleted. TTL is specified in seconds and is relative to the time Publish call is made.Q: How do I specify a TTL for my messages?You can specify a TTL using the console or via API. TTL can be specified at publish time for a message, using the message attribute below. There is a different attribute for each platform. An attribute specified for a platform is applicable only for notification deliveries to that platform.Q: What is the default TTL?SNS uses a default Time to Live (TTL) of 4 weeks for all mobile platforms.Q: Do TTL message attributes override TTLs specified in a message payload?Yes. Google FCM and Amazon ADM allow you to specify a TTL within the message payload. If you specify TTL within the message payload and also within a message attribute, SNS will follow the message attribute.Q: What happens if I specify TTL=0?Some platforms treat TTL = 0 as a special case and attempt to deliver the message immediately, else let it expire. If you specify TTL = 0, SNS will relay your message to the appropriate service with TTL = 0 in order to take advantage of this special case.Q: What SNS endpoints support TTL?You can use TTL with the following mobile push endpoints: APNS, APNS_Sandbox, FCM, ADM, Baidu, and WNS. Microsoft MPNS does not currently support TTL. TTL is also not supported for SQS, HTTP, email or SMS endpoints.Q: What does the Delivery Status feature of Amazon SNS do?The Delivery Status feature lets you collect information on success rates, failure rates and dwell times of your push notifications for the supported mobile notification platforms. The currently supported platforms include Apple (APNS), Google (FCM), Windows (WNS and MPNS), Amazon (ADM), and Baidu. The status information is captured in the Amazon CloudWatch log groups created by Amazon SNS on your behalf. Additionally, you can create actionable metrics in Amazon CloudWatch and trigger alarms based on the patterns you are interested in.Q: Is the Delivery Status feature in Amazon SNS available only for mobile push notifications? Do you plan to support this feature for other endpoint types?Currently the Delivery Status feature is available for mobile push notifications and SMS. We will evaluate extending this to other endpoint types based on feedback from customers.Q: How do I activate the Delivery Status feature?You can activate the Delivery Status feature from theAmazon SNS console. From your Application, choose the Delivery Status option in the Application Actions drop-down menu. For details, please read ourdocumentation.Q: Can I activate the Delivery Status feature from the Amazon SNS APIs?Yes, you can activate this feature from Amazon SNS APIs by adding the relevant application-level attributes. Ourdocumentationgoes over the application-level attributes that you need to add and the specific API calls that need to be made to enable this feature.Q: How much does the Delivery Status feature cost?There is currently no additional Amazon SNS charge for using the Delivery Status feature. However, depending upon your usage, you may incur charges for using CloudWatch since this feature creates Amazon CloudWatch log groups. Read ourpricing pagefor more information about CloudWatch pricing and free tier.Q: Why can you only choose a sampling percentage for successful delivery attempts and not sample failed delivery attempts?Based on feedback we received from customers, we found that most developers are interested in knowing all the delivery attempt failures for their applications \u2013 and prefer to only store sample successful deliveries rather than logging all of them.Q: How can I set alarms based on failure metrics or dwell time metrics?After activating the Delivery Status feature, you need to define a Log Metrics Filter inAmazon CloudWatchLogs for the log group that gets created byAmazon SNSon your behalf. This metrics filter can be defined to extract information that you are interested in, such as failure rate and dwell time. Once a Metric Filter is defined, you can create it and assign it to a Metric. This metric can then be used to set alarms or send notifications based on thresholds you define.

{"instruction": "Answer the following AWS FAQ question", "input": "Storage Example", "output": "The following example reflects a scenario where your file access patterns change over time, and includes each of EFS IA and EFS Archive's pricing dimensions. The example assumes that the two EFS Lifecycle policies to move files between EFS Standard, EFS Infrequent Access (IA), and EFS Archive are set.\nAssume that your file system is located in the US East (N. Virginia) Region. At the beginning of a 31-day month, your file system stores 200 GB of files on EFS Standard, 500 GB of files on EFS IA, and 2 TB of files on EFS Archive. On the 15th day of the month, EFS Lifecycle Management, without Intelligent Tiering, moves 50% of your EFS Standard files to the EFS IA class and 10% of your EFS IA files to the EFS Archive class after 14 days of having not been accessed. On average, your client application reads 200 GB of files from your EFS IA and 100 GB of files from your EFS Archive each month.\nFirst, we calculate the pro-rated storage usage:\nStandard Storage: 200 GB of EFS Standard storage for 14 days (GB-Hours): 200 GB x 14 days x (24 hours / day) = 67,200 GB-Hours 100 GB of EFS Standard storage for 17 days (GB-Hours): 100 GB x 17 days x (24 hours / day) = 40,800 GB-Hours Total EFS Standard storage usage (GB-Hours): 67,200 GB-Hours + 40,800 GB-Hours = 108,000 GB-Hours\nIA Storage: 500 GB of EFS IA for 14 days (GB-Hours): 500 GB x 14 x (24 hours / day) = 168,000 GB-Hours 100 GB of files from EFS Standard to EFS IA for 17 days (GB-Hours) = 100 GB x 17 x (24 hours / day) = 40,800 GB-Hours 450 GB of EFS IA (after 50 GB is moved to EFS Archive) = 450 GB x 17 x (24 hours / day) = 183,600 GB-Hours\nTotal EFS IA usage (GB-Hours): 168,000 GB-Hours + 40,800 GB-Hours + 326,400 GB-Hours = 392,400 GB-Hours\nArchive Storage: 2 TB of EFS IA for 31 days (GB-Hours): 1,000 GB x 14 x (24 hours / day) = 1,488,000 GB-Hours 50 GB of files from EFS IA to EFS Archive for 17 days (GB-Hours): 50 GB x 17 x (24 hours / day) = 20,400 GB-Hours Total EFS Archive storage usage (GB-Hours): 1,488,000 GB-Hours + 20,400 GB-Hours = 1,508,400 GB-Hours\nNext, we convert the storage usage into GB-months and calculate the storage charge: Total EFS Standard charge: 108,000 GB-Hours x (1 month / 744 hours) x $0.30/GB-month = $43.55 Total EFS IA charge: 392,400 GB-Hours x (1 month / 744 hours) x $0.0165/GB-month = $8.70 Total EFS Archive charge: 1,508,400 GB-Hours x (1 month / 744 hours) x $0.008/GB-month = $16.22 Total EFS storage charge: $43.55 + $8.70 + $16.22\u00a0= $68.47\nNext, we calculate the access charges for files in EFS IA and EFS Archive:\nIA Data Tiering: Data Tiering (files moved from EFS Standard to EFS IA): 100 GB * $0.01/GB = $1.00 IA read access charge: 200 GB * $0.01/GB = $2.00\nElastic Throughput read charge: 200 GB * $0.03/GB = $6.00\nTotal EFS IA tiering and access charges: $1.00 + $2.00 + $6.00 = $9.00\nArchive Data Tiering: Data Tiering (files moved from Infrequent Access to Archive): 50 GB * $0.03/GB = $1.50 Archive read access charge: 100 GB *$0.03/GB = $3.00\nElastic Throughput read charge: 100 GB * $0.03/GB = $3.00\nTotal EFS IA tiering and access charges: $1.50 + $3.00 + $3.00 = $7.50\nTotal EFS tiering and access charge: $9.00 + $7.50 = $16.50\nFinally, we calculate the total EFS charge for the month:\nTotal monthly charges = Total storage charge + Total access charge = $68.47 + $16.50\u00a0= $84.97 (TCO - $0.0315/GB) [Source: https://aws.amazon.com/efs/faq/]"}

{"instruction": "Answer the following AWS FAQ question", "input": "What factors can affect the performance consistency of my HDD-backed volumes?", "output": "Throughput Optimized HDD (st1) and Cold HDD (sc1) volumes attached to EBS-optimized instances are designed to offer consistent performance, delivering within 10% of the expected throughput performance 99% of the time in a given year. There are several factors that could affect the level of consistency you see. For example, the relative balance between random and sequential I/O operations on the volume can impact your performance. Too many random small I/O operations will quickly deplete your I/O credits and lower your performance down to the baseline rate. Your throughput rate may also be lower depending on the instance selected. Although st1 can drive throughput up to 500 MB/s, performance will be limited by the separate instance-level limit for EBS traffic. Another factor is taking a snapshot which will decrease expected write performance down to the baseline rate, until the snapshot completes. This is specific to st1 and sc1.Your performance can also be impacted if your application isnt sending enough I/O requests. This can be monitored by looking at your volumes queue depth and I/O size. The queue depth is the number of pending I/O requests from your application to your volume. For maximum consistency, HDD-backed volumes must maintain an average queue depth (rounded to the nearest whole number) of four or more for every 1 MB sequential I/O.

{"instruction": "Answer the following AWS FAQ question", "input": "What is the AWS Flow Framework? How does it help me with coordinating my workflow?", "output": "AWS Flow Framework is a programming framework that enables you to develop Amazon SWF-based applications quickly and easily. It abstracts the details of task-level coordination and asynchronous interaction with simple programming constructs. Coordinating workflows in Amazon SWF involves initiating remote actions that take variable times to complete (e.g. activity tasks) and implementing the dependencies between them correctly.AWS Flow Framework makes it convenient to express both facets of coordination through familiar programming concepts. For example, initiating an activity task is as simple as making a call to a method. AWS Flow Framework automatically translates the call into a decision to initiate the activity task and lets Amazon SWF assign the task to a worker, monitor it, and report back on its completion. The framework makes the outcome of the task, including its output data, available to you in the code as the return values from the method call. To express the dependency on a task, you simply use the return values in your code, as you would for typical method calls. The frameworks runtime will automatically wait for the task to complete and continue your execution only when the results are available. Behind the scenes, the frameworks runtime receives worker and decision tasks from Amazon SWF, invokes the relevant methods in your program at the right times, and formulates decisions to send back to Amazon SWF. By offering access to Amazon SWF through an intuitive programming framework, the AWS Flow Framework makes it possible to easily incorporate asynchronous and event driven programming in the development of your applications.

For example, if your data requires three search partitions, you will have 3 search instances in your search domain. As your traffic increases beyond the capacity of a single search instance, each partition is replicated to provide additional CPU capacity, adding an additional three search instances to your search domain. Further increases in traffic will result in additional replicas, to a maximum of 5, for each search partition. [Source: https://aws.amazon.com/cloudsearch/faqs/]"}

{"instruction": "Answer the following AWS FAQ question", "input": "Does the I/O size of my application reads and writes affect the rate of IOPS I get from my Provisioned IOPS SSD (io2 Block Express) volumes?", "output": "Yes, it does. When you provision IOPS for io2 Block Express volumes, the IOPS rate you get depends on the I/O size of your application reads and writes. Provisioned IOPS volumes have a base I/O size of 16KB. So, if you have provisioned a volume with 40,000 IOPS for an I/O size of 16KB, it will achieve up to 40,000 IOPS at that size. If the I/O size is increased to 256 KB, then you will achieve up to 16,000 IOPS, since the maximum throughput of 4000 MiB/s is achieved at 16,000 IOPS. For more details, please visit the technical documentation on Provisioned IOPS volumes.\u00a0You can use Amazon CloudWatch to monitor your throughput and I/O sizes.

{"instruction": "Answer the following AWS FAQ question", "input": "How does EC2 perform maintenance?", "output": "AWS regularly performs routine hardware, software, power, and network maintenance with minimal disruption across all EC2 instance types. This is achieved by a combination of technologies and methods across the entire AWS Global infrastructure, such as live update and live migration as well as redundant and concurrently maintainable systems. Non-intrusive maintenance technologies such as live update and live migration do not require instances to be stopped or rebooted. Customers are not required to take any action prior to, during or after live migration or live update. These technologies help improve application uptime and reduce your operational effort. Amazon EC2 uses live update to deploy software to servers quickly with minimal impact to customer instances. Live update ensures that customers\u2019 workloads run on servers with software that is up-to-date with security patches, new instance features and performance improvements. Amazon EC2 uses live migration when running instances need to be moved from one server to another for hardware maintenance or to optimize placement of instances or to dynamically manage CPU resources. Amazon EC2 has been expanding the scope and coverage of non-intrusive maintenance technologies over the years so that scheduled maintenance events are a fallback option rather than the primary means of enabling routine maintenance.

{"instruction": "Answer the following AWS FAQ question", "input": "Media", "output": "Media companies often deal with the need to transmit a large amount of static content to their customers with a constantly changing number of readers/viewers. An example is a video streaming service such as Netflix or Amazon Video, which streams a large amount of video content to the viewers. This is a perfect fit for aContent Delivery Network (https://aws.amazon.com/caching/cdn/), where data is stored on a globally distributed set of caching servers. Another aspect of media applications is that load tends to be spikey and unpredictable. Imagine a blog on a website that a celebrity just tweeted about, or the website of a Football team during the Super Bowl. Such a large spike of demand to a small subset of content is a challenge to most databases since they are limited in their per-key throughput. Since memory has a much higher throughput than disk, adatabase cache (https://aws.amazon.com/caching/database-caching/)would resolve the issue by redirecting the reads to the in memory cache.

These include open data sets hosted by theAWS Open Data Sponsorship Programand in theAmazon Sustainability Data Initiative(ASDI) catalog. Open data sets are different than other commercial or free data sets in four key ways. First, AWS Data Exchange requires customers to explicitly agree to the Data Subscription Agreement outlining the terms that the data provider set when publishing their product, whereas open data does not have terms of use and is only governed by the provider specific open data license. Second, customers must authenticate using an AWS account to subscribe to commercial or free data sets whereas open data sets can be accessed without any authentication via S3 APIs. Third, AWS Data Exchange gives data providers access to daily, weekly and monthly reports detailing subscription activity, whereas with Registry of Open Data on AWS, data providers must analyze their own logs to track usage of data. Finally, to become a data provider on AWS Data Exchange, qualified customers mustregister as a data provideron the AWS Marketplace Management Portal to be eligible to list both free and commercial products, whereas any customer can add free data toRegistry of Open Data on AWS through GitHuband may apply to the Open Data Sponsorship Program for AWS to sponsor the costs of storage and bandwidth for select open data sets.

{"instruction": "Answer the following AWS FAQ question", "input": "Why would I use snapshots?", "output": "You can take point-in-time snapshots of your Volume Gateway volumes in the form of Amazon EBS snapshots. You can use a snapshot of your volume as the starting point for a new Amazon EBS volume, which you can then attach to an Amazon EC2 instance. Using this approach, you can easily supply data from your on-premises applications to your applications running on Amazon EC2 if you require additional on-demand compute capacity for data processing or replacement capacity for disaster recovery purposes.For cached volumes, where your volume data is already stored in Amazon S3, you can use snapshots to preserve versions of your data. Using this approach, you can revert to a prior version when required or repurpose a point-in-time version as a new volume. You can initiate snapshots on a scheduled or ad hoc basis. When taking a new snapshot, only the data that has changed since your last snapshot is stored. If you have a volume with 100 GB of data, but only 5 GB of data have changed since your last snapshot, only the 5 additional GB of snapshot data will be stored in Amazon S3. When you delete a snapshot, only the data not needed for any other snapshot is removed.For stored volumes, where your volume data is stored on-premises, snapshots provide durable, off-site backups in Amazon S3. You can create a new volume from a snapshot if you need to recover a backup. You can also use a snapshot of your volume as the starting point for a new Amazon EBS volume, which you can then attach to an Amazon EC2 instance.

{"instruction": "Answer the following AWS FAQ question", "input": "How do I monitor Valkey CPU utilization?", "output": "ElastiCache provides two different sets of metrics to measure the CPU utilization of your cache depending on your cache deployment choice. When using ElastiCache Serverless, you can monitor the CPU utilization with the ElastiCache Processing Units (ECPU) metric. The number of ECPUs consumed by your requests depends on the vCPU time taken and the amount of data transferred. Each read and write, like the Valkey GET and SET commands or the Memcached get and set commands, requires 1 ECPU for each kilobyte (KB) of data transferred. Some commands that operate on in-memory data structures can consume more vCPU time than a GET or SET command. ElastiCache calculates the number of ECPUs consumed based on the vCPU time taken by the command compared to a baseline of the vCPU time taken by a SET or GET command. If your command takes additional vCPU time and transfers more data than the baseline of 1 ECPU, then ElastiCache calculates the ECPUs required based on the higher of the two dimensions.When designing your own cluster, you can monitor EngineCPUUtilization and CPUUtilization. The CPUUtilization metric measures the CPU utilization for the instance (node), and the EngineCPUUtilization metric measures the utilization at the engine process level. You need the EngineCPUUtilization metric in addition to the CPUUtilization metric, as the main engine process is single threaded and uses just one CPU of the multiple CPU cores available on an instance. Therefore, the CPUUtilization metric does not provide precise visibility into the CPU utilization rates at the process level. We recommend that you use both the CPUUtilization and EngineCPUUtilization metrics together to get a detailed understanding of CPU utilization for your Valkey clusters.Both sets of metrics are available in all AWS Regions, and you can access these metrics using Amazon CloudWatch or in theconsole (https://console.aws.amazon.com/elasticache/). Additionally, we recommend that you visitthe documentation (https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonElastiCache/latest/red-ug/CacheMetrics.WhichShouldIMonitor.html)to learn about useful metrics for performance monitoring.

{"instruction": "Answer the following AWS FAQ question", "input": "Does the I/O size of my application reads and writes affect the rate of throughput I get from my HDD-backed volumes?", "output": "Yes. The throughput rate you get depends on the I/O size of your application reads and writes. HDD-backed volumes process reads and writes in I/O sizes of 1MB. Sequential I/Os are merged and processed as 1 MB units while each non-sequential I/O is processed as 1MB even if the actual I/O size is smaller. Thus, while a transactional workload with small, random IOs, such as a database, won't perform well on HDD-backed volumes, sequential I/Os and large I/O sizes will achieve the advertised performance of st1 and sc1 for a longer period of time.

{"instruction": "Answer the following AWS FAQ question", "input": "Why use Amazon API Gateway?", "output": "Amazon API Gateway provides developers with a simple, flexible, fully managed, pay-as-you-go service that handles all aspects of creating and operating robust APIs for application back ends. With API Gateway, you can launch new services faster and with reduced investment so you can focus on building your core business services. API Gateway was built to help you with several aspects of creating and managing APIs:1)Metering. API Gateway helps you define plans that meter and restrict third-party developer access to your APIs. You can define a set of plans, configure throttling, and quota limits on a per API key basis. API Gateway automatically meters traffic to your APIs and lets you extract utilization data for each API key.2)Security. API Gateway provides you with multiple tools to authorize access to your APIs and control service operation access. API Gateway allows you to leverage AWS administration and security tools, such as AWS Identity and Access Management (IAM) and Amazon Cognito, to authorize access to your APIs. API Gateway can verify signed API calls on your behalf using the same methodology AWS uses for its own APIs. Using custom authorizers written as AWS Lambda functions, API Gateway can also help you verify incoming bearer tokens, removing authorization concerns from your backend code.3)Resiliency. API Gateway helps you manage traffic with throttling so that backend operations can withstand traffic spikes. API Gateway also helps you improve the performance of your APIs and the latency your end users experience by caching the output of API calls to avoid calling your backend every time.4)Operations Monitoring. After an API is published and in use, API Gateway provides you with a metrics dashboard to monitor calls to your services. The API Gateway dashboard, through integration with Amazon CloudWatch, provides you with backend performance metrics covering API calls, latency data and error rates. You can enable detailed metrics for each method in your APIs and also receive error, access or debug logs in CloudWatch Logs.5)Lifecycle Management. After an API has been published, you often need to build and test new versions that enhance or add new functionality. API Gateway lets you operate multiple API versions and multiple stages for each version simultaneously so that existing applications can continue to call previous versions after new API versions are published.6)Designed for Developers. API Gateway allows you to quickly create APIs and assign static content for their responses to reduce cross-team development effort and time-to-market for your applications. Teams who depend on your APIs can begin development while you build your backend processes.7)Real-Time Two-Way Communication.Build real-time two-way communication applications such as chat apps, streaming dashboards, and notifications without having to run or manage any servers. API Gateway maintains a persistent connection between connected users and enables message transfer between them. [Source: https://aws.amazon.com/api-gateway/faqs/]"}

{"instruction": "Answer the following AWS FAQ question", "input": "How does my data transfer allowance work for instances?", "output": "Every Lightsail instance plan includes a data transfer allowance. Both data transfer IN and data transfer OUT of your instance count toward your data transfer allowance. If you exceed your data transfer allowance, you will only be charged for the excess data transfer OUT from a Lightsail instance to the Internet or to AWS resources using the public IP address of the instance. You will not be charged for the excess data transfer IN to your Lightsail instance (see Example 1). Your data transfer allowance resets every month, and your instance can consume it whenever it needs to within the month. Data transfer allowance is aggregated for instances of the same bundle (i.e. bundleId) in a region (see Examples 2 and 3). Data transfer allowance is also aggregated for IPv4 and IPv6 instances of the same size (see Example 4). Deleting an instance and creating a new instance does not reset the data transfer allowance (see Example 5).  Example 1: Assume you have one $5/month instance bundle (or bundleId \u2018nano_3_0\u2019) with 1TB/month data transfer allowance. If you send 500GB of data to the Internet (data transfer OUT) and 400GB of data to the instance (data transfer IN), you will have consumed 900GB of your 1TB allowance. If you further send 200GB of data to the Internet, you will exceed your allowance by 100GB, and will be charged a data transfer OUT overage fee for 100GB. If you next send 200GB of data to the instance, you will not be charged for overage.  Example 2: If you have two $5/month instance bundles (or bundleId \u2018nano_3_0\u2019) for a full month in a region, each with 1TB/month data transfer allowance, you get 2TB data transfer allowance in aggregate. If you send 1.5TB of data to the Internet with the first instance and 100 GB of data to the Internet with the second instance, you will still be 400GB under your total allowance of 2TB, and you will not be charged any data transfer OUT overage fees.  Example 3: You create two sets of instance bundles: set A with two $5/month instance bundles (bundleId \u2018nano_3_0\u2019) and set B with three $7/month instance bundles (bundleId \u2018micro_3_0\u2019), both in US West (Oregon) Region. In aggregate, this gives you 2TB of data transfer allowance for set A, and 6TB of data transfer allowance for set B. If you transfer 3TB of data to the Internet through set A instances and 4TB of data to the Internet through Set B instances, you will exceed your data transfer allowance for Set A instances and will be charged a data transfer OUT overage fee for 1TB. You will still be within your allowance for Set B instances by 2TB.\nExample 4: Assume you have consumed 600GB of the total 1TB data transfer allowance for your $3.5/month IPv6 instance bundle (bundleId \u2018nano_ipv6_3_0\u2019) within the first 20 days of the billing month. You decide to switch the networking type of your instance to dual-stack (bundleId \u2018nano_3_0\u2019 charged at $5/month price) on the 21st day. Your data transfer utilization for the month will not reset, and will remain at 600GB, with 400GB allowance left. During the remainder of the billing month, if you send 500GB of data to the Internet, you will accrue data transfer OUT overage charges for 100GB.\nExample 5: You have three $5/month instance bundles (bundleId \u2018nano_3_0\u2019), each with 1TB/month data transfer allowance. Assume you have consumed 1TB of the total 3TB data transfer allowance within the billing month, which leaves you with 2TB of remaining data transfer allowance. If you delete all your instances, and create three new instances of the same bundle (bundleId \u2018nano_3_0\u2019) in the same region within the same billing month, your data transfer utilization will still be 1TB and remaining data transfer allowance will still be 2TB. You can transfer 2TB more data through your instances within the same month before you start accruing any data transfer OUT overage charges. [Source: https://aws.amazon.com/lightsail/faq/]"}

{"instruction": "Answer the following AWS FAQ question", "input": "Where are Amazon S3 Replication metrics published?", "output": "The bytes pending, operations pending, and replication latency metrics are published in the source AWS account and destination AWS Region. However, the operations failed replication metric is published in the source AWS account and source AWS Region instead of the destination AWS Region. There are two primary reasons for this. First, if the operations failed replication metric is published in the destination Region the customer will not see the metric when the destination bucket is erroneously configured. For example, if the customer has mis-typed the destination bucket name in the replication configuration and replication is unsuccessful because the destination bucket is not found, the customer will not be able to see any value for this metric because the destination Region will be unknown when the destination bucket is not found. Second, if the customer is replicating to an opt-in destination Region like Hong Kong or Bahrain, in the event of replication failures the customer will not see any metric if the source account has not opted-in for the destination Region.

All CloudFront customers receive 1 TB data transfer out and 10,000,000 HTTP and HTTPS Requests for Amazon CloudFront free of charge, even when these limits are exceeded. IfData Transfer Out to InternetYou are charged for the volume of data transferred out from Amazon CloudFront edge locations, measured in GB. You can see the rates for Amazon CloudFront data transfer to the internet here. Note that your data transfer usage is totaled separately for specific geographic regions, and then cost is calculated based on pricing tiers for each area. If you use other AWS services as the origins of your files, you are charged separately for your use of those services, including for storage and compute hours. If you use an AWS origin (such as Amazon S3, Amazon EC2, and so on), effective December 1, 2014,we do not charge for AWS data transfer out to Amazon CloudFront. This applies to data transfer from all AWS Regions to all global CloudFront edge locations.Data Transfer Out to OriginYou will be charged for the volume of data transferred out, measured in GB, from the Amazon CloudFront edge locations to your origin (both AWS origins and other origin servers). You can see the rates for Amazon CloudFront data transfer to Originhere (https://aws.amazon.com/cloudfront/pricing/).HTTP/HTTPS RequestsYou will be charged for number of HTTP/HTTPS requests made to Amazon CloudFront for your content.

This monthly fee is pro-rated by the hour. For example, if you had your custom SSL certificate associated with at least one CloudFront distribution for just 24 hours (i.e. 1 day) in the month of June, your total charge for using the custom SSL certificate feature in June will be (1 day / 30 days) * $600 = $20.

{"instruction": "Answer the following AWS FAQ question", "input": "Application Programming Interfaces (APIs)", "output": "Today, most web applications are built upon APIs. An API generally is a RESTful web service that can be accessed over HTTP and exposes resources that allow the user to interact with the application. When designing an API, its important to consider the expected load on the API, the authorization to it, the effects of version changes on the API consumers and most importantly the APIs ease of use, among other considerations. Its not always the case that an API needs to instantiate business logic and/or make a backend requests to a database on every request. Sometimes serving a cached result of the API will deliver the most optimal and cost-effective response. This is especially true when you are able to cache the API response to match the rate of change of the underlying data. Say for example, you exposed a product listing API to your users and your product categories only change once per day. Given that the response to a product category request will be identical throughout the day every time a call to your API is made, it would be sufficient to cache your API response for the day. By caching your API response, you eliminate pressure to your infrastructure including your application servers and databases. You also gain from faster response times and deliver a more performant API.Amazon API Gateway (https://aws.amazon.com/api-gateway/)is a fully managed service that makes it easy for developers to create, publish, maintain, monitor, and secure APIs at any scale.

You can useApplication Load Balancers (ALB) (https://aws.amazon.com/elasticloadbalancing/application-load-balancer/),Network Load Balancers (NLB) (https://aws.amazon.com/elasticloadbalancing/network-load-balancer/), andEC2 Instances (https://aws.amazon.com/ec2/)in private subnets as VPC origins with CloudFrontIf CloudFront managed solutions dont meet your use-case requirements, below are some of the alternative approaches available:Custom Origin Headers: With CloudFront, you can append custom headers to your incoming requests and then configure your origin to validate these specific header values, effectively limiting access to only those requests routed through CloudFront. This method creates an additional layer of authentication, significantly reducing the risk of unauthorized direct access to your origin.IP Allowlisting: You can configure your origin's security group or firewall to exclusively permit incoming traffic from CloudFront's IP ranges. AWS maintains and regularly updates these IP ranges for your convenience. For detailed information on implementing IP allowlisting, please consult our comprehensive documentation at:https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonCloudFront/latest/DeveloperGuide/LocationsOfEdgeServers.html#managed-prefix-list (https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonCloudFront/latest/DeveloperGuide/LocationsOfEdgeServers.html#managed-prefix-list).

{"instruction": "Answer the following AWS FAQ question", "input": "What happens when my facility's network connection goes down?", "output": "EC2 instances and EBS volumes on the Outpost will continue to operate normally and can be accessed locally via the local gateway. Similarly, AWS service resources such as ECS worker nodes continue to run locally. However, API availability will be degraded, for instance run/start/stop/terminate APIs may not work. Instance metrics and logs will continue to be cached locally for a few hours, and will be pushed to the AWS Region when connectivity returns. Disconnection beyond a few hours however may result in loss of metrics and logs. If you expect to lose network connectivity, we strongly recommend regularly testing your workload to ensure it behaves properly in this state when an Outpost is disconnected. For S3 on Outposts, if the network connection to your Outpost is lost, you will not be able to access your objects.

{"instruction": "Answer the following AWS FAQ question", "input": "How does Amazon EMR Serverless help save costs on big data deployments?", "output": "There are three ways in which Amazon EMR Serverless can help you save costs. First, there is no operational overhead of managing, securing, and scaling clusters. Second, EMR Serverless automatically scales workers up at each stage of processing your job and scales them down when they\u2019re not required. You\u2019re charged for aggregate vCPU, memory, and storage resources used from the time a worker starts running until it stops, rounded up to the nearest second with a 1-minute minimum. For example, your job may require 10 workers for the first 10 minutes of processing the job and 50 workers for the next 5 minutes. With fine-grained automatic scaling, you incur costs for only 10 workers for 10 minutes and 50 workers for 5 minutes. As a result, you don\u2019t have to pay for underutilized resources. Third, EMR Serverless includes the Amazon EMR performance-optimized runtime for Apache Spark and Apache Hive, and Presto. The Amazon EMR runtime is API-compatible and over twice as fast as standard open-source analytics engines, so your jobs run faster and incur fewer compute costs.

For maximum performance consistency with new volumes created from a snapshot, we recommend enabling Fast Snapshot Restore (FSR) on your snapshots. EBS volumes restored from FSR-enabled snapshots instantly receive their full performance.Another factor that can impact your performance is if your application isnt sending enough I/O requests. This can be monitored by looking at your volumes queue depth. The queue depth is the number of pending I/O requests from your application to your volume. For maximum consistency, a Provisioned IOPS volume must maintain an average queue depth (rounded to the nearest whole number) of one for every 1000 provisioned IOPS in a minute. For example, for a volume provisioned with 3000 IOPS, the queue depth average must be 3.

{"instruction": "Answer the following AWS FAQ question", "input": "I want to ensure that there is only one execution for each activation of my business process (e.g. a transaction, a submission, or an assignment). How do I accomplish this?", "output": "When you start new workflow executions you provide an ID for that workflow execution. This enables you to associate an execution with a business entity or action (e.g. customer ID, filename, serial number). Amazon SWF ensures that an executions ID is unique while it runs. During this time, an attempt to start another execution with the same ID will fail. This makes it convenient for you to satisfy business needs where no more than one execution can be running for a given business action, such as a transaction, submission or assignment. Consider a workflow that registers a new user on a website. When a user clicks the submit button, the users unique email address can be used to name the execution. If the execution already exists, the call to start the execution will fail. No additional code is needed to prevent conflicts as a result of the user clicking the button more than one when the registration is in progress.Once the workflow execution is complete (either successfully or not), you can start another workflow execution with the same ID. This causes a new run of the workflow execution with the same execution ID but a different run ID. The run ID is generated by Amazon SWF and multiple executions that have the same workflow execution ID can be differentiated by the run ID. By allowing you to reuse workflow execution IDs in such a manner, Amazon SWF allows you to address use cases such as retries. For example, in the above user registration example, assume that the workflow execution failed when creating a database record for the user. You can start the workflow execution again with the same execution ID (users email address) and do not have to create a new ID for retrying the registration.

An SCP is required but is not the only control that determines which principals in an account can access resources to grant principals in an account access to resources. The effective permission on a principal in an account that has an SCP attached is the intersection of what is allowed explicitly in the SCP and what is allowed explicitly in the permissions attached to the principal. For example, if an SCP applied to an account states that the only actions allowed are Amazon EC2 actions, and the permissions on a principal in the same AWS account allow both EC2 actions and Amazon S3 actions, the principal is able to access only the EC2 actions.Principals in a member account (including the root user for the member account) cannot remove or change SCPs that are applied to that account.

{"instruction": "Answer the following AWS FAQ question", "input": "Internet of Things (IoT)", "output": "The Internet of Things is a concept behind gathering and delivering information from a device and the physical world via device sensors to the internet or application consuming the data. The value of IoT is being able to understand the captured data at near real time intervals which ultimately allows the consuming system and applications the ability to respond rapidly to that data. Take for example, a device that transmits its GPS coordinates. Your IoT application could respond by suggesting points of interest relative to the proximity of those coordinates. Furthermore, if you had stored preferences related to the user of the device, you could fine tune those recommendations tailored to that individual. In this particular example, the speed at which the application can respond to the coordinates is critical to achieving a great user experience. Caching can play an important role here, for example, the points of interest along with the geo coordinates could be stored in a key/value store such as Redis to enable fast retrieval. From an application development perspective, you can essentially code your IoT application to respond to any event given there is a programmatic means to do so. Important considerations to be made when building an IoT architecture include the response time involved with analyzing the ingested data, architecting a solution that can scale N number of devices and delivering an architecture that is cost-effective.AWS IoT (https://aws.amazon.com/iot-platform/)is a managed cloud platform that lets connected devices easily and securely interact with cloud applications and other devices.Further Reading:Managing IoT and Time Series Data with Amazon ElastiCache for Redis (https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/database/managing-iot-and-time-series-data-with-amazon-elasticache-for-redis/) [Source: https://aws.amazon.com/caching/]"}

{"instruction": "Answer the following AWS FAQ question", "input": "How do data streams scale in on-demand mode to handle increase in write throughput?", "output": "A data stream in on-demand mode accommodates up to double its previous peak write throughput observed in the last 30 days. As your data streams write throughput hits a new peak, Kinesis Data Streams scales the streams capacity automatically. For example, if your data stream has a write throughput that varies between 10 MB/second and 40 MB/second, Kinesis Data Streams will ensure that you can easily burst to double the peak throughput of 80 MB/second. Subsequently, if the same data stream sustains a new peak throughput of 50 MB/second, Data Streams will ensure that there is enough capacity to ingest 100 MB/second of write throughput. However, you will see ProvisionedThroughputExceeded exceptions if your traffic grows more than double the previous peak within a 15-minute duration. You need to retry these throttled requests.

{"instruction": "Answer the following AWS FAQ question", "input": "Do I need to change my existing database schema or application to use Aurora PostgreSQL Limitless Database?", "output": "Yes, you might need to adjust your database schema to use Aurora PostgreSQL Limitless Database. All sharded tables are required to contain the shard key, so this data might need to be backfilled. For example, an accounting application may might split its data by user, using the User-ID column, since each user is independent from the others. While the user table itself naturally contains thiscolumn, other tables might not, such as a table that holds the line items of invoices. Since these tables also need to be split by user to collocate the tables for optimal query performance, the User-ID column needs to be added to the table.There are no naming constraints on the column that is used to split the data, but the column definition must match. You will need to add the shard key to application queries and you might also need to adjust your queries and transactions for optimal performance. For example, looking up an invoice using the Invoice-ID when the table is only split by User-ID would be slow because the query would need to execute on all database instances. However, if the query also specifies the User-ID, the query will be routed to the single database instance that contains all the orders for that User-ID, reducing the latency of the query.

{"instruction": "Answer the following AWS FAQ question", "input": "How is Impala different than Hive?", "output": "Impala executes SQL queries using a massively parallel processing (MPP) engine, while Hive executes SQL queries using MapReduce. Impala avoids Hive\u2019s overhead from creating MapReduce jobs, giving it faster query times than Hive. However, Impala uses significant memory resources and the cluster\u2019s available memory places a constraint on how much memory any query can consume. Hive is not limited in the same way, and can successfully process larger data sets with the same hardware. Generally, you should use Impala for fast, interactive queries, while Hive is better for ETL workloads on large datasets. Impala is built for speed and is great for ad hoc investigation, but requires a significant amount of memory to execute expensive queries or process very large datasets. Because of these limitations, Hive is recommended for workloads where speed is not as crucial as completion. Click here to view some performance benchmarks between Impala and Hive.

{"instruction": "Answer the following AWS FAQ question", "input": "What happens to my data warehouse cluster availability and data durability in the event of individual node failure?", "output": "<p>Amazon Redshift will automatically detect and replace a failed node in your data warehouse cluster. On Dense Compute (DC) and Dense Storage (DS2) clusters, the data is stored on the compute nodes to ensure high data durability. When a node is replaced, the data is refreshed from the mirror copy on the other node. RA3 clusters and Redshift serverless are not impacted the same way since the data is stored in Amazon S3 and the local drive is just used as a data cache. The data warehouse cluster will be unavailable for queries and updates until a replacement node is provisioned and added to the DB. Amazon Redshift makes your replacement node available immediately and loads your most frequently accessed data from Amazon S3 first to allow you to resume querying your data as quickly as possible. Single node clusters do not support data replication. In the event of a drive failure, you must restore the cluster from snapshot on S3.

{"instruction": "Answer the following AWS FAQ question", "input": "When should I use Amazon SQS long polling, and when should I use Amazon SQS short polling?", "output": "In almost all cases, Amazon SQS long polling is preferable to short polling. Long-polling requests let your queue consumers receive messages as soon as they arrive in your queue while reducing the number of empty ReceiveMessageResponse instances returned.Amazon SQS long polling results in higher performance at reduced cost in the majority of use cases. However, if your application expects an immediate response from a ReceiveMessage call, you might not be able to take advantage of long polling without some modifications to your application.For example, if your application uses a single thread to poll multiple queues, switching from short polling to long polling will probably not work, because the single thread will wait for the long-poll timeout on any empty queues, delaying the processing of any queues that might contain messages.In such an application, it is a good practice to use a single thread to process only one queue, allowing the application to take advantage of the benefits that Amazon SQS long polling provides.

These statistics are recorded for a period of two weeks so that you can access historical information and gain a better perspective on how your clusters or services are performing. There is no additional charge for this. To learn more, please visit,\u00a0Amazon ECS CloudWatch metrics.\nFor enhanced metrics, use CloudWatch Container Insights to collect, aggregate, and summarize metrics and logs from your containerized applications and microservices, available for your Amazon ECS clusters running on Amazon EC2 and AWS Fargate. CloudWatch automatically collects metrics for many resources, such as CPU, memory, disk, and network. Container Insights also provides diagnostic information, such as container restart failures, to help you isolate issues and resolve them quickly. For Amazon ECS, Container Insights collects metrics at the cluster, task and service levels on both Linux and Windows Server instances. It can collect metrics at the instance-level only on Linux instances.Network metrics are available only for containers in\u00a0bridge\u00a0network mode and\u00a0awsvpc\u00a0network mode. They are not available for containers in\u00a0host\u00a0network mode.
